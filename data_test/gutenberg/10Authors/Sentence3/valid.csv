And yet the moment Tom happened to be good to her, and kind--and this occurred every now and then--all her sore places were healed, and she was happy happy and proud, for this was her son, her nigger son, lording it among the whites and securely avenging their crimes against her race. There were two grand funerals in Dawson's Landing that fall--the fall of 1845. One was that of Colonel Cecil Burleigh Essex, the other that of Percy Driscoll.;53

The world's whole round smokes ominously, amazed    And trembling as its pregnant AEtna swells. Combustibles on hot combustibles    Run piling, for one spark to roll in fire    The mountain-torrent of infernal ire    And leave the track of devils where men built. Perceptive of a doom, the sinner's guilt    Confesses in a cry for help shrill loud,    If drops the chillness of a passing cloud,    To conscience, reason, human love in vain:    None save they but the souls which them contain.;520
As soon as Pat made his appearance, the lieutenant ordered him to stand on guard at the door, where he kept him until nightfall. When our men came in, I inquired whether they knew anything of the troopers. They one and all averred that they had left them sleeping in the hut, and that they had no notion where they could have gone.;8659

Lieutenant Broadstreet had, in the meantime, fixed on a good site for a fort on the summit of a precipice by the river-side, and his men were busily engaged in cutting and fixing up the palisades which were to surround it. So much was he occupied in the duty he had to perform, that he could rarely come over to Roaring Water while I was so fully employed that I had no time to visit him.;8659
And she has taught me how to say good-morning and good-night to her, which is by lifting my right hoof for her to shake and also how to say good-bye I do that with my left footbut only for practice, because there hasnt been any but make-believe good-byeing yet, and I hope there wont ever be.

He held him unclean who had been branded by the law and how should it have been otherwise?

There had been more singing by Mrs. Detlor.

On the way we looked into the stables, where we found the five horses and baggage mules all right so that the men, if they had deserted, must have done so on foot. We opened the door of the hut, hoping that possibly by this time the missing men might have returned but neither of them was there. The drunken fellow was, however, still sleeping on, and probably would have slept on until his hut companions came back, had we not roused him up.;8659

After walking for a quarter of an hour or more, I found myself in the midst of an Indian burial-ground, which I recognized by the number of small platforms, raised on posts and thatched over, rising in all directions. Besides the platforms, I observed several strange-looking figures fixed to the top of tall poles, and composed, as far as I could judge, of bits of coloured rags and skins, which fluttered in a weird fashion in the night breeze. The chief stopped before a couple of these fantastic-looking objects, and, with folded arms, gazed up at them, uttering some words which I was too far off to hear distinctly, though the sound of his voice reached my ears.;8659
Uttering these lofty boasts, the whole person of the speaker seemed instinct with his ambition.

Fortunately, Lieutenant Broadstreet had sufficient supplies of provisions for all our wants.

Perhaps, after their three or four days' experience, they may have begun to suspect that they would not reach their El Dorado without some considerable difficulty, should they ever get there at all and they possibly consoled themselves with the idea that, since they had been retaken, they were getting off very cheaply. Our meal over, we moved on as before.

From the distance at which he stood from the scene, Adrian could only distinguish the dark outline of Rienzi's form he could only hear the faint sound of his mighty voice he could only perceive, in the subdued yet waving sea of human beings that spread around, their heads bared in the last rays of the sun, the unutterable effect which an eloquence, described by contemporaries almost as miraculous,--but in reality less so from the genius of the man than the sympathy of the audience,--created in all, who drank into their hearts and souls the stream of its burning thoughts. It was but for a short time that that form was visible to the earnest eye, that that voice at intervals reached the straining ear, of Adrian di Castello but that time sufficed to produce all the effect which Adrian himself had desired.
