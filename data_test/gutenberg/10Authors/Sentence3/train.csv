Irene in the Palace of Adrian di Castello. As the Cyprian gazed on the image in which he had embodied a youth of dreams, what time the living hues flushed slowly beneath the marble,--so gazed the young and passionate Adrian upon the form reclined before him, re-awakening gradually to life. And, if the beauty of that face were not of the loftiest or the most dazzling order, if its soft and quiet character might be outshone by many, of loveliness less really perfect, yet never was there a countenance that, to some eyes, would have seemed more charming, and never one in which more eloquently was wrought that ineffable and virgin expression which Italian art seeks for in its models,--in which modesty is the outward, and tenderness the latent, expression the bloom of youth, both of form and heart, ere the first frail and delicate freshness of either is brushed away: and when even love itself, the only unquiet visitant that should be known at such an age, is but a sentiment, and not a passion!;761

Englishmen, as you know, regard those airy perches on the top of the coach as the best seats and for the first few miles I discovered abundance of excellent reasons for justifying the opinion of our neighbors.

The events of his work are thus already shaped to his hand--the characters already created--what remains for him, is the inner, not outer, history of man--the chronicle of the human heart and it is by this that he introduces a new harmony between character and event, and adds the completer solution of what is actual and true, by those speculations of what is natural and probable, which are out of the province of history, but belong especially to the philosophy of romance. And--if it be permitted the tale-teller to come reverently for instruction in his art to the mightiest teacher of all, who, whether in the page or on the scene, would give to airy fancies the breath and the form of life,--such, we may observe, is the lesson the humblest craftsman in historical romance may glean from the Historical Plays of Shakespeare.

CHAPTER VIII  The sun was low down in the west, and shining through and under the great oak and beech trees, so that everything seemed to be turned to orange and gold. It was the outlaws' supper time, the sun being their clock in the forest and the men were gathering together to enjoy their second great meal of the day, the other being breakfast, after having which they always separated to go hunting through the woods to bring in the provisions for the next day. Robin Hood's men, then, were scattered about under the shade of a huge spreading oak tree, waiting for the roast venison, which sent a very pleasant odor from the glowing fire of oak wood, and young Robin was seated on the mossy grass close by the thatched shed which formed the captain's headquarters, where Maid Marian was busy spreading the supper for the little party who ate with Robin Hood himself.;3840

Robin could have sent a sharp-pointed arrow at this beautiful bird, and perhaps have killed it, for he knew well that roast duck or drake is very nice stuffed with sage and onions, and with green peas to eat therewith but he never thought of using his bow, and he was content to feast his eyes upon the bird's beauty and watch its motions.;3840

At length, Adrian, his visor down, rode slowly into the green space, amidst the cheers of his party. The two Knights, at either end, gravely fronted each other they made the courtesies with their lances, which, in friendly and sportive encounters, were customary and, as they thus paused for the signal of encounter, the Italians trembled for the honour of their chief: Montreal's stately height and girth of chest forming a strong contrast, even in armour, to the form of his opponent, which was rather under the middle standard, and though firmly knit, slightly and slenderly built. But to that perfection was skill in arms brought in those times, that great strength and size were far from being either the absolute requisites, or even the usual attributes, of the more celebrated knights in fact, so much was effected by the power and the management of the steed, that a light weight in the rider was often rather to his advantage than his prejudice: and, even at a later period, the most accomplished victors in the tourney, the French Bayard and the English Sydney, were far from remarkable either for bulk or stature.;761

For virtues such as these, his grave crimes against God and man, against religion and chartered and solemnly-sworn rights have been palliated, as if oppression became more tolerable because the oppressor was an accomplished linguist and a good marksman.

The two then went to the studio again, and, leaving the curtain drawn back, Hagar arranged Mrs. Detlor in position and began his task. He stood looking at the canvas for a time, as though to enter into the spirit of it again then turned to his model.

We accordingly hobbled and staked our horses close at hand and we then collected wood for our fire, and made down our beds with our saddles and horse-cloths. While we were seated at supper, I proposed to my companion to go a short distance from the wood, that we might command a more extensive range of view than we could where we were seated so that should the runaways be anywhere in the neighbourhood, we might find them out by the light of their fire. No glare appeared, however, along the whole length of the forest but still that was no proof that they were not somewhere in one of its recesses, as, even should they have kindled a fire, the trees might conceal its light from us.;8659

THE MESSAGE   By Honore De Balzac    Translated by Ellen Marriage    To M. le Marquis Damaso Pareto     THE MESSAGE   I have always longed to tell a simple and true story, which should strike terror into two young lovers, and drive them to take refuge each in the other's heart, as two children cling together at the sight of a snake by a woodside. At the risk of spoiling my story and of being taken for a coxcomb, I state my intention at the outset. I myself played a part in this almost commonplace tragedy so if it fails to interest you, the failure will be in part my own fault, in part owing to historical veracity.;251

While the crowd hailed the proposition of Rienzi while their shouts yet filled the air while Raimond, somewhat taken by surprise, sought by signs and gestures to convey at once his gratitude and his humility, the Tribune-Elect, casting his eyes around, perceived many hitherto attracted by curiosity, and whom, from their rank and weight, it was desirable to secure in the first heat of the public enthusiasm.""""""";761

But it is still a grave question whether Italy is ripe for self-government--and whether, were it possible that the Austrian domination could be shaken off--the very passions so excited, the very bloodshed so poured forth, would not ultimately place the larger portion of Italy under auspices less favourable to the sure growth of freedom, than those which silently brighten under the sway of the German Caesar.;761

"""""""It was upon that same evening, and while the earlier stars yet shone over the city, that Walter de Montreal, returning, alone, to the convent then associated with the church of Santa Maria del Priorata (both of which belonged to the Knights of the Hospital, and in the first of which Montreal had taken his lodgment), paused amidst the ruins and desolation which lay around his path.

Pulling it up, I found it not unlike a radish in taste and consistency. Searching about, I soon found several more: and although not likely to be very nutritious, the roots served to stop the gnawings of hunger, and enabled me to make my way with a more elastic step.

The body of it ran:      DEAR MR. HAGAR--I have just learned on my return from the Continent     with the Branscombes that you are at Herridon. My daughter Mildred,     whom you have never seen--and that is strange, we having known each     other so long--is staying at the View House there with the Margraves,     whom, also, I think, you do not know. I am going down to-morrow, and     will introduce you all to each other.;1285

She picked up the remains and laid them upon her palm, and said:  Poor little anty, Im so sorry and I didnt mean to kill you, but there wasnt any other way to save you, it was such a hurry. She is a dear and sweet little lady, and when she goes it will give me a sore heart. But she will be happy with you, and if your heart is old and tired, give it into her keeping she will make it young again, she will refresh it, she will make it sing.;53
