CHAPTER IV  It was a very strange life for a boy who had been accustomed to every comfort, but young Robin enjoyed it, for everything seemed to be so new and fresh, and the men treated him as if he had come to them for the purpose of being made into a pet. They were, of course, fierce outlaws and robbers, ready to turn their bows and swords against anyone but the poor people who lived in and about the forest liked and helped them, for Robin Hood's men never did them harm, while as to young Robin, they were all eager to take him out with them and show him the wonders of the forest.

But he did not seem to be entirely alone there in the dense forest, for there was another young robin, with large eyes and a speckled jacket, sitting upon a twig and watching him intently.

It was so quiet and seemed so safe that directly after the reeds parted again and another bird swam out from among the sheltering reeds. Robin knew this directly as a drake, but he had never before seen one with such a gloriously green head, rich chestnut-colored breast, soft gray back, or glistening metallic purple wing spots. Robin could have sent a sharp-pointed arrow at this beautiful bird, and perhaps have killed it, for he knew well that roast duck or drake is very nice stuffed with sage and onions, and with green peas to eat therewith but he never thought of using his bow, and he was content to feast his eyes upon the bird's beauty and watch its motions.;3840
Robin was Just thinking how beautiful it all was, when the danger for which the drake was watching in the sky suddenly came from the water beneath. One of the downy yellow dabs had swum two yards away from the others and his mother, after a daddy long-legs which had flown down on to the surface of the water, and had opened its little flat beak to seize it, when there was a whirl in the water, a rush and splash, and two great jaws armed with sharp teeth closed over the duckling, which was visible one moment, gone the next, and Robin drew an arrow out to fit to his bow-string. But he was too late to send it whizzing at the great pike, which had given a whisk with its tail and gone off to some lair in the reeds to peacefully swallow the young duck, while the rest followed their quacking father and mother back to the shelter of the reeds, rushes, and sedge, where the moor-hen and her brood were already safe, while, startled by the alarm, the heron bent down as it spread its great gray wing's, sprang up, gave a few flaps and flops, and began to sail round above the pool till it grew peaceful again, when, stretching out its legs, the heron dropped back into the water, stood motionless gazing down with meditative eyes as if quite satisfied that no fish would touch it, and then, _flick_!;3840

Robin's first act was to stand and stare, for the heap consisted of bales similar to those with which he had seen the mules laden a couple of days back, and tied up together a few yards away were the very mules, while the little crowd of men who were busy bore a very strong resemblance to those by whom the attack was made on the previous day. Robin knew nothing in those days about the old proverb of jumping out of the frying-pan into the fire, but he felt something of the kind as he found himself face to face with the marauders who had seized upon the bales of cloth and put his aunt's servants to flight, and without a moment's hesitation he turned and began to hurry back, but ran into the arms of a huge fellow who caught him up as if he had been a baby.

CHAPTER VI  It was all very wonderful to young Robin when he saw Little John or one of the other men let fly an arrow with a twang of the bow-string and a sharp whizz of the wings through the air, to quiver in a mark eighty or a hundred yards away, or to pierce some flying wild goose or duck passing in a flock high in air but by degrees that which had seemed so marvellous soon ceased to astonish him, and at last looked quite easy. For Robin was delighted with his bow and arrows as soon as he found that he could send one of the light-winged shafts whistling in a beautiful curve to stick in some big tree. Then he began shooting at smaller trees, and then at saplings when he could hit the small trees.;3840

It was a brave fight, but all in vain, and a few minutes later the boy was standing triumphantly over poor Robin, with the gay jerkin rolled up under his arm and the little fellow struggled to his feet in his trunk hose and white linen shirt, hot, angry, and torn, and wishing with all his might that he were as big and strong as the tyrant who had mastered him.""";3840

But the does and fawns did not know that, for as Robin said this he was fitting an arrow to his bow-string, and threatening to send it flying after the shrieking jay which had given the alarm. He forgot, too, that he had eaten heartily of delicious roasted fawn only a few days before. As he wandered on through glades where the sun seemed to send rays of glowing silver down through the oak or beech leaves as if to fill the golden cups which grew beneath them among the soft green moss, he would come out suddenly perhaps on one of the sunny forest pools, perhaps where the water was half covered with broad flat leaves, among which were silver blossoms, in other places golden, with arrow weed at the sides, along with whispering reeds and sword-shaped iris plants.;3840
"""Robin drew a breath which sounded like a deep sigh, and ceased his struggling, letting his enemy force him to walk backward among the bracken and nearly fall again and again, till all at once the savage young lout shouted:  """"Ah, here it is'"""" and loosening one hand, he was in the act of stooping to pick up the staff he had dropped in leaping upon his victim, who now made a bound which sent the boy face downward on to his staff, while Robin dashed off to where his own quarter-staff lay among the bracken--a spot he had glanced at again and again. He seized it in an instant, and was about to bound away among the trees, but his enemy had recovered himself, and staff in hand, came after him at so terrible a rate that Robin only avoided a swishing blow at his legs by dodging round a tree, which received the stroke.

CHAPTER VIII  The sun was low down in the west, and shining through and under the great oak and beech trees, so that everything seemed to be turned to orange and gold. It was the outlaws' supper time, the sun being their clock in the forest and the men were gathering together to enjoy their second great meal of the day, the other being breakfast, after having which they always separated to go hunting through the woods to bring in the provisions for the next day. Robin Hood's men, then, were scattered about under the shade of a huge spreading oak tree, waiting for the roast venison, which sent a very pleasant odor from the glowing fire of oak wood, and young Robin was seated on the mossy grass close by the thatched shed which formed the captain's headquarters, where Maid Marian was busy spreading the supper for the little party who ate with Robin Hood himself.;3840

Robin in his excitement began to run after him to continue the beating, but the swineherd went too fast, and on the impulse of the moment the victor stopped short, dropping his own staff and unslinging his bow from where it hung.;3840
There was a rush under some low boughs, and another rush over a patch of brambles and tall bracken then the cob made a bold dash at a dense mass of low growth, when there was a violent jerk as he made a bound, followed by a feeling as if the boy's arms were being torn out at the shoulders, a rush through the air, a heavy blow, and a sensation of tearing, and all was, giddiness and pain.

This gift of penetration and embrace,    His prize from tidal battles lost or won,    Reveals the scheme to animate his race:    How that it is a warfare but begun    Unending with no Power to interpose    No prayer, save for strength to keep his ground,    Heard of the Highest never battle's close,    The victory complete and victor crowned:    Nor solace in defeat, save from that sense    Of strength well spent, which is the strength renewed.;520
Dimly men see it menacing apace    To overthrow, perchance uproot the race. Within, without, they are a field of tares:    Fruitfuller for them when the contest squares,    And wherefore warrior service they must yield,    Shines visible as life on either field. That is my comfort, following shock on shock,    Which sets faith quaking on their firmest rock.;520
These imbecilities gave me time to form my own conclusions at a glance, and, with a perspicacity rare at that age, to analyze the husband and wife whose solitude was about to be so rudely disturbed. The husband seemed to be a specimen of a certain type of nobleman, the fairest ornaments of the provinces of our day. He wore big shoes with stout soles to them.;251
WITH THE HUNTRESS      THROUGH the water-eye of night,    Midway between eve and dawn,    See the chase, the rout, the flight    In deep forest oread, faun,    Goat-foot, antlers laid on neck    Ravenous all the line for speed. See yon wavy sparkle beck    Sign of the Virgin Lady's lead. Down her course a serpent star    Coils and shatters at her heels    Peals the horn exulting, peals    Plaintive, is it near or far.;520
"""THE PURSE   By Honore De Balzac   Translated by Clara Bell      To Sofka     """"Have you observed, mademoiselle, that the painters and   sculptors of the Middle Ages, when they placed two figures in   adoration, one on each side of a fair Saint, never failed to   give them a family likeness? When you here see your name among   those that are dear to me, and under whose auspices I place my   works, remember that touching harmony, and you will see in   this not so much an act of homage as an expression of the   brotherly affection of your devoted servant,                                                  """"DE BALZAC."""" THE PURSE   For souls to whom effusiveness is easy there is a delicious hour that falls when it is not yet night, but is no longer day the twilight gleam throws softened lights or tricksy reflections on every object, and favors a dreamy mood which vaguely weds itself to the play of light and shade.""";251
More closely, warmly: hither, hither! she,    The very she called forth by ripened blood    For its next breath of being, murmurs she,    Allurement she, fulfilment she,    The stream within us urged to flood    Man's cry, earth's answer, heaven's consent O she,    Maid, woman and divinity    Our over-earthly, inner-earthly mate    Unmated she, our hunger and our fruit    Untasted she our written fate    Unread Life's flowering, Life's root:    Unread, divined unseen, beheld    The evanescent, ever-present she,    Great Nature's stern necessity    In radiance clothed, to softness quelled    With a sword's edge of sweetness keen to take    Our breath for bliss, our hearts for fulness break. The murmur hushes down, the veil is rent.;520
The silence following on the crash alarmed us, and we hurried up. Finding the key in the latch, we happily took the liberty of entering, and we found you lying motionless on the ground. My mother went to fetch what was needed to bathe your head and revive you.;251
During this brief moment they both went through one of those storms of agitation of which the effects in the soul may be compared to those of a stone flung into a deep lake. The most delightful waves of thought rise and follow each other, indescribable, repeated, and aimless, tossing the heart like the circular ripples, which for a long time fret the waters, starting from the point where the stone fell. Hippolyte returned to the studio bearing the portrait.;251
"""Their noble and simple manners at first made no great impression on the painter, but subsequently, as he recalled all the details of the incident, he was greatly struck by them. When they reached the floor beneath that occupied by the painter's studio, the old lady gently observed, """"Adelaide, you left the door open."""" """"That was to come to my assistance,"""" said the painter, with a grateful smile.""";251
"""""""So he, too, has seen that young lady!"""" said Souchet. And then there were comments, laughter, innocent mockery, full of the liveliness familiar to artists, but which pained Hippolyte frightfully.""";251
Elsewhere, as at the Baronne de Rouville's, he always piqued curiosity without satisfying it. Who, after the Restoration, could remember the attachment which, before the Revolution, had bound this man to his friend's wife, dead now these twenty year? The leader, who appeared the least dilapidated of these wrecks, came gallantly up to Madame de Rouville, kissed her hand, and sat down by her.;251
Greece was my lamp: burnt out for lack of oil    Rome, Python Rome, prey of its robber spoil! All structures built upon a narrow space    Must fall, from having not your hosts for base. O thrice must one be you, to see them shift    Along their desert flats, here dash, there drift    With faith, that of privations and spilt blood,    Comes Reason armed to clear or bank the flood!;520
"""At least, it was thus that the painter chose to interpret her attitude and countenance, and he presently sat down again by her side. """"Madame,"""" he said, """"in a very short time the colors of that pastel will have disappeared. The portrait will only survive in your memory.""";251
"""Insensibly the painter was led into confidences, and confessed his love. The moment he mentioned the Rue de Suresnes, and a young girl living on the fourth floor, """"Stop, stop,"""" cried Souchet lightly. """"A little girl I see every morning at the Church of the Assumption, and with whom I have a flirtation.""";251
The rapture shed the torture weaves    The direst blow on human heart she deals:    The pain to know the seen deceives    Nought true but what insufferably feels. And stabs of her delicious note,    That is as heavenly light to hearing, heard    Through shelter leaves, the laughter from her throat,    We answer as the midnight's morning's bird. She laughs, she wakens gleeful cries    In her delicious laughter part revealed    Yet mother is she more of moans and sighs,    For longings unappeased and wounds unhealed.;520
Out came all our follies in fact. If it is pleasant to remember past dangers, is it not at least as pleasant to recall past delights? We live through the joy a second time.;251
Where you will still see the face that is dear to you, others will see nothing at all. Will you allow me to reproduce the likeness on canvas? It will be more permanently recorded then than on that sheet of paper.;251
"""asked Souchet. """"Have you ever followed the girl when she patters off to church in the morning?"""" said Joseph Bridau, a young dauber in Gros' studio.""";251
"""Facing the chimney, above a mahogany chest of drawers of handsome and tasteful design, was the portrait of an officer of rank, which the dim light did not allow him to see well but from what he could make out he thought that the fearful daub must have been painted in China. The window-curtains of red silk were as much faded as the furniture, in red and yellow worsted work, [as] if this room """"contrived a double debt to pay."""" On the marble top of the chest of drawers was a costly malachite tray, with a dozen coffee cups magnificently painted and made, no doubt, at Sevres.""";251
His easel was ready with a fresh canvas, and his palette set, his brushes cleaned, the spot and the light carefully chosen. And till the dinner hour he worked at the painting with the ardor artists throw into their whims. He went again that evening to the Baronne de Rouville's, and remained from nine till eleven.;251
I see marauder runagates    Across us shoot their dusky wink    I hear the parliament of chats    In haws beside the river's brink    And drops the vole off alder-banks,    To push his arrow through the stream. These busy people had our thanks    For tickling sight and sound, but theme    They were not more than breath we drew    Delighted with our world's embrace:    The moss-root smell where beeches grew,    And watered grass in breezy space    The silken heights, of ghostly bloom    Among their folds, by distance draped. 'Twas Youth, rapacious to consume,    That cried to have its chaos shaped:    Absorbing, little noting, still    Enriched, and thinking it bestowed    With wistful looks on each far hill    For something hidden, something owed.;520
"""What, have you not known her for what she is by the way she holds her bag?"""" The two friends walked up and down for some time, and several young men who knew Souchet or Schinner joined them. The painter's adventure, which the sculptor regarded as unimportant, was repeated by him.""";251
Thus the girl's little stratagem only served to embarrass them both. While talking with Madame Leseigneur, for Hippolyte called her so, on the chance of being right, he examined the room, but unobtrusively and by stealth. The Egyptian figures on the iron fire-dogs were scarcely visible, the hearth was so heaped with cinders two brands tried to meet in front of a sham log of fire-brick, as carefully buried as a miser's treasure could ever be.;251
Since with his weapons, all the arms of Night,    Frail men have challenged Lucifer to fight,    Have matched in hostile ranks, enrolled, erect,    The human and Satanic intellect,    Determined for their uses to control    What forces on the earth and under roll,    Their granite rock runs igneous now they stand    Pledged to the heavens for safety of their land. They cannot learn save grossly, gross that are:    Through fear they learn whose aid is good in war. --My sister, as I read them in my glass,    Their field of tares they take for pasture grass.;520
"""The coat, new on the first, on the second was old the powder in his hair looked less white, the gold of the fleurs-de-lis less bright, the shoulder straps more hopeless and dog's eared his intellect seemed more feeble, his life nearer the fatal term than in the former. In short, he realized Rivarol's witticism on Champcenetz, """"He is the moonlight of me."""" He was simply his double, a paler and poorer double, for there was between them all the difference that lies between the first and last impressions of a lithograph.""";251
How waken them that have not any bent    Save browsing--the concrete indifferent! Friend Lucifer supplies them solid stuff:    They fear not for the race when full the trough. They have much fear of giving up the ghost    And these are of mankind the unnumbered host.;520
"""It is a queer thing, monsieur, the mother's name is not the same as the daughter's. Ah, but when they go for a walk in the Tuileries, mademoiselle is very smart, and she never goes out but she is followed by a lot of young men but she shuts the door in their face, and she is quite right. The proprietor would never allow----""""  The coach having come, Hippolyte heard no more, and went home.""";251
She, tenderness, is pitiless to them    Resisting in her godhead nature's truth. No flower their face shall be, but writhen stem    Their youth a frost, their age the dirge for youth. These miserably disinclined,    The lamentably unembraced,    Insult the Pleasures Earth designed    To people and beflower the waste.;520
Schinner had therefore chosen his friends among the most honorable and distinguished men. Fastidious in the selection of his intimates, he desired to raise still further a position which his talent had placed high. The work to which he had devoted himself from boyhood, by compelling him to dwell in solitude--the mother of great thoughts--had left him the beautiful beliefs which grace the early days of life.;251
But, my dear fellow, we all know her. The mother is a Baroness. Do you really believe in a Baroness living up four flights of stairs?;251
Then came a day that clipped for him the thread,       And their first touch of lips, as he lay cold,       Was all of earthly in their love untold,    Beyond all earthly known to them who wed. So has there come the gust at South-west flung       By sudden volt on eves of freezing mist,       When sister snowflake sister snowdrop kissed,    And one passed out, and one the bell-head hung. SONG IN THE SONGLESS      THEY have no song, the sedges dry,          And still they sing.;520
Englishmen, as you know, regard those airy perches on the top of the coach as the best seats and for the first few miles I discovered abundance of excellent reasons for justifying the opinion of our neighbors. A young fellow, apparently in somewhat better circumstances, who came to take the seat beside me from preference, listened to my reasoning with inoffensive smiles. An approximate nearness of age, a similarity in ways of thinking, a common love of fresh air, and of the rich landscape scenery through which the coach was lumbering along,--these things, together with an indescribable magnetic something, drew us before long into one of those short-lived traveller's intimacies, in which we unbend with the more complacency because the intercourse is by its very nature transient, and makes no implicit demands upon the future.;251
The silence which generally prevails at that time makes it particularly dear to artists, who grow contemplative, stand a few paces back from the pictures on which they can no longer work, and pass judgement on them, rapt by the subject whose most recondite meaning then flashes on the inner eye of genius. He who has never stood pensive by a friend's side in such an hour of poetic dreaming can hardly understand its inexpressible soothingness. Favored by the clear-obscure, the material skill employed by art to produce illusion entirely disappears.;251
"""He felt himself mean, sordid, a fool he longed to punish himself, to rend his heart. A few tears rose to his eyes by an irresistible impulse he sprang up, clasped Adelaide in his arms, pressed her to his heart, and stole a kiss then with the simple heartiness of an artist, """"I ask for her for my wife!"""" he exclaimed, looking at the Baroness.""";251
Daughter of light, the joyful light,    She bids her couples face full East,    Reflecting radiance, even when from her feast    Their outstretched arms brown deserts disunite,    The lion-haunted thickets hold apart. In love the ruddy hue declares great heart    High confidence in her whose aid is lent    To lovers lifting the tuned instrument,    Not one of rippled strings and funeral tone. And doth the man pursue a tightened zone,    Then be it as the Laurel God he runs,    Confirmed to win, with countenance the Sun's.;520
"""the young man asked Adelaide. """"Oh, nothing,"""" replied the Baroness. """"Adelaide has sat up late for some nights to finish some little piece of woman's work, and would not listen to me when I told her that a day more or less did not matter----""""  Hippolyte was not listening.""";251
"""Grant me, I beg, as a neighborly favor, the pleasure of doing you this service. There are times when an artist is glad of a respite from his greater undertakings by doing work of less lofty pretensions, so it will be a recreation for me to paint that head."""" The old lady flushed as she heard the painter's words, and Adelaide shot one of those glances of deep feeling which seem to flash from the soul.""";251
I must make a full confession. I stopped behind the last shrub in the avenue, pulled up my collar, rubbed my shabby hat and my trousers with the cuffs of my sleeves, dusted my coat with the sleeves themselves, and gave them a final cleansing rub one against the other. I buttoned my coat carefully so as to exhibit the inner, always the least worn, side of the cloth, and finally had turned down the tops of my trousers over my boots, artistically cleaned in the grass.;251
"""Torn, troth, then are the cheeks of the wife of that man fallen    slaughtered,    Orphans his babes, full surely he reddens the earth with his    blood-drops,    Rotting, round him the birds, more numerous they than the women.""""

If he had followed the call of his passion, he would have gone to his neighbor's door at six in the morning, when he went to his studio. However, he still was reasonable enough to wait till the afternoon. But as soon as he thought he could present himself to Madame de Rouville, he went downstairs, rang, blushing like a girl, shyly asked Mademoiselle Leseigneur, who came to let him in, to let him have the portrait of the Baron.;251
"""""""Is it true? Oh! tell me the truth I can hear the truth.""";251
Wherefore the Pleasures pass them by:    For death they live, in life they die. Her head the Goddess from them turns,    As from grey mounds of ashes in bronze urns. She views her quivering couples unconsoled,    And of her beauty mirror they become,    Like orchard blossoms, apple, pear and plum,    Free of the cloud, beneath the flood of gold.;520
Picture to yourselves a young man of middle height, but very well proportioned, a bright, expressive face, dark hair, blue eyes, moist lips, and white and even teeth. A certain not unbecoming pallor still overspread his delicately cut features, and there were faint dark circles about his eyes, as if he were recovering from an illness. Add, furthermore, that he had white and shapely hands, of which he was as careful as a pretty woman should be add that he seemed to be very well informed, and was decidedly clever, and it should not be difficult for you to imagine that my traveling companion was more than worthy of a countess.;251
As confiding as a child, it seemed to him base to analyze a pleasure. After a short lapse of time he perceived that the old lady and her daughter were playing cards with the old gentleman. As to the satellite, faithful to his function as a shadow, he stood behind his friend's chair watching his game, and answering the player's mute inquiries by little approving nods, repeating the questioning gestures of the other countenance.;251
One of them comes in a carriage with servants, and is said to have sixty thousand francs a year. However, they are very quiet tenants, as you are, monsieur and economical! they live on nothing, and as soon as a letter is brought they pay for it.;251

At midnight a small people danced the dales,    So thin that they might dwindle through a sieve    XXV      Ringed mushrooms told of them, and in their throats,       Old wives that gathered herbs and knew too much. The pensioned forester beside his crutch,    Struck showers from embers at those bodeful notes.

"""She grew even paler. When I drew the letters from beneath my pillow and held them out to her, she took them mechanically then, trembling from head to foot, she said in a hollow voice:  """"And _I_ burned all his letters!--I have nothing of him left!--Nothing! nothing!""""""";251
The first, a man of about sixty, wore one of the coats invented, I believe, for Louis XVIII., then on the throne, in which the most difficult problem of the sartorial art had been solved by a tailor who ought to be immortal. That artist certainly understood the art of compromise, which was the moving genius of that period of shifting politics. Is it not a rare merit to be able to take the measure of the time?;251
Whether he meant to come down from his perch, or whether he made some ill-judged movement, believing himself to be on the floor--the event did not allow of his remembering exactly the cause of his accident--he fell, his head struck a footstool, he lost consciousness and lay motionless during a space of time of which he knew not the length. A sweet voice roused him from the stunned condition into which he had sunk. When he opened his eyes the flash of a bright light made him close them again immediately but through the mist that veiled his senses he heard the whispering of two women, and felt two young, two timid hands on which his head was resting.;251
"""A fall may be dangerous."""" The young girl stole a look at the painter and at the pictures in the studio. Her expression and her glances revealed perfect propriety her curiosity seemed rather absence of mind, and her eyes seemed to speak the interest which women feel, with the most engaging spontaneity, in everything which causes us suffering.""";251
He begged me to go myself to break the news to her. He bade me look for a key which he wore on a ribbon about his neck. I found it half buried in the flesh, but the dying boy did not utter a sound as I extricated it as gently as possible from the wound which it had made.;251
Back to the primal brute shall he retrace    His path, doth he permit to force her chains    A soft Persuader coursing through his veins,    An icy Huntress stringing to the chase:    What one the flash disdains    What one so gives it grace. But is he rightly manful in her eyes,    A splendid bloodless knight to gain the skies,    A blood-hot son of Earth by all her signs,    Desireing and desireable he shines    As peaches, that have caught the sun's uprise    And kissed warm gold till noonday, even as vines. Earth fills him with her juices, without fear    That she will cast him drunken down the steeps.;520
The canon racked his brains to discover a reason for his niece's tears. The lady's husband silently digested his dinner content, apparently, with the Countess' rather vague explanation, sent through the maid, putting forward some feminine ailment as her excuse. We all went early to bed.;251
Oh! any poet who should have listened to our talk, for heaven knows how many stages beyond Montargis, would have reaped a harvest of flaming epithet, rapturous description, and very tender confidences. Our bashful fears, our silent interjections, our blushes, as we met each other's eyes, were expressive with an eloquence, a boyish charm, which I have ceased to feel.;251
Her eyes were red and swollen, nothing of their beauty remained, nothing looked out of them save her bitter and exceeding grief it was as if a gray cloud covered the place through which the sun had shone. I gave her the story of the accident in a few words, without laying too much stress on some too harrowing details. I told her about our first day's journey, and how it had been filled with recollections of her and of love.;251

These, the irreverent of Life's design,    Division between natural and divine    Would cast these vaunting barrenness for best,    In veins of gathered strength Life's tide arrest    And these because the roses flood their cheeks,    Vow them in nature wise as when Love speaks. With them is war and well the Goddess knows    What undermines the race who mount the rose    How the ripe moment, lodged in slumberous hours,    Enkindled by persuasion overpowers:    Why weak as are her frailer trailing weeds,    The strong when Beauty gleams o'er Nature's needs,    And timely guile unguarded finds them lie. They who her sway withstand a sea defy,    At every point of juncture must be proof    Nor look for mercy from the incessant surge    Her forces mixed of craft and passion urge    For the one whelming wave to spring aloof.;520
However, my youthful enthusiasm determined to hasten thither on foot as fast as possible. Bad news travels swiftly, and I wished to be first at the chateau. I asked for the shortest way, and hurried through the field paths of the Bourbonnais, bearing, as it were, a dead man on my back.;251
Should pity bless the tremulous voice of woe    He lifts for pity, limp his offspring show. For him requiring woman's arts to please    Infantile tastes with babe reluctances,    No race of giants! In the woman's veins    Persuasion ripely runs, through hers the pains.;520
Stopped they then on the fair-flower'd field of Scamander, their    thousands    Many as leaves and the blossoms born of the flowerful season. Even as countless hot-pressed flies in their multitudes traverse,    Clouds of them, under some herdsman's wonning, where then are the    milk-pails    Also, full of their milk, in the bountiful season of spring-time    Even so thickly the long-haired sons of Achaia the plain held,    Prompt for the dash at the Trojan host, with the passion to crush    them. Those, likewise, as the goatherds, eyeing their vast flocks of goats,    know    Easily one from the other when all get mixed o'er the pasture,    So did the chieftains rank them here there in their places for    onslaught,    Hard on the push of the fray and among them King Agamemnon,    He, for his eyes and his head, as when Zeus glows glad in his thunder,    He with the girdle of Ares, he with the breast of Poseidon.;520
"""""""But come in,"""" said Adelaide, who had no doubt heard him come down from the studio. The painter followed, bashful and out of countenance, not knowing what to say, happiness had so dulled his wit. To see Adelaide, to hear the rustle of her skirt, after longing for a whole morning to be near her, after starting up a hundred time--""""I will go down now""""--and not to have gone this was to him life so rich that such sensations, too greatly prolonged, would have worn out his spirit.""";251
If the work is a picture, the figures represented seem to speak and walk the shade is shadow, the light is day the flesh lives, eyes move, blood flows in their veins, and stuffs have a changing sheen. Imagination helps the realism of every detail, and only sees the beauties of the work. At that hour illusion reigns despotically perhaps it wakes at nightfall!;251
His memory cruelly retraced the fatal truth, minute by minute. He distinctly saw the purse lying on the green cloth but then, doubtful no longer, he excused Adelaide, telling himself that persons in misfortune should not be so hastily condemned. There was, of course, some secret behind this apparently degrading action.;251
Next morning he rose, not having slept. The heartache, that terrible malady of the soul, had made rapid inroads. To lose the bliss we dreamed of, to renounce our whole future, is a keener pang than that caused by the loss of known happiness, however complete it may have been for is not Hope better than Memory?;251
Her choice of him, should kind occasion nod,    Aspiring blends the Titan with the God    Yet unto dwarf and mortal, she, submiss    In her high Lady's mandate, yields the kiss    And is it needed that Love's daintier brute    Be snared as hunter, she will tempt pursuit. She is great Nature's ever intimate    In breast, and doth as ready handmaid wait,    Until perverted by her senseless male,    She plays the winding snake, the shrinking snail,    The flying deer, all tricks of evil fame,    Elusive to allure, since he grew tame. Hence has the Goddess, Nature's earliest Power,    And greatest and most present, with her dower    Of the transcendent beauty, gained repute    For meditated guile.;520

Doth man divide divine Necessity    From Joy, between the Queen of Beauty's breasts    A sword is driven for those most glorious twain    Present her armed to bless and to constrain.;520
In that little space I had seen frank and undisguised human nature under two very different aspects, in such a sort that there was a certain grotesque element in the very midst of a most terrible tragedy. The evening that followed was dreary. I was tired.;251

"""""""My dear,"""" said the old lady to the young one, """"I am cold make a little fire, and give me my shawl."""" Adelaide went into a room next the drawing-room, where she no doubt slept, and returned bringing her mother a cashmere shawl, which when new must have been very costly the pattern was Indian but it was old, faded and full of darns, and matched the furniture.

Then was the gracious birth of man's new day    Divided from the haunted night it shone. That quiet dawn was Reverence whereof sprang    Ethereal Beauty in full morningtide. Another sun had risen to clasp his bride:    It was another earth unto him sang.;520
"""""""I left my purse here!"""" he said to the young girl. """"No,"""" she said, reddening.""";251
I put the shoes first advisedly, for they made an even deeper impression upon me than a seedy black coat, a pair of threadbare trousers, a flabby cravat, or a crumpled shirt collar. There was a touch of the magistrate in the man, a good deal more of the Councillor of the Prefecture, all the self-importance of the mayor of the arrondissement, the local autocrat, and the soured temper of the unsuccessful candidate who has never been returned since the year 1816. As to countenance--a wizened, wrinkled, sunburned face, and long, sleek locks of scanty gray hair as to character--an incredible mixture of homely sense and sheer silliness of a rich man's overbearing ways, and a total lack of manners just the kind of husband who is almost entirely led by his wife, yet imagines himself to be the master apt to domineer in trifles, and to let more important things slip past unheeded--there you have the man!;251
The young girl ran lightly off to the lumber-room and reappeared with a bundle of small wood, which she gallantly threw on the fire to revive it. It would be rather difficult to reproduce the conversation which followed among these three persons. Hippolyte, guided by the tact which is almost always the outcome of misfortune suffered in early youth, dared not allow himself to make the least remark as to his neighbors' situation, as he saw all about him the signs of ill-disguised poverty.;251
I said to myself as I saw the ghastly pallor of her face contrasting with her brown hair, and heard the guttural tones of her voice. The havoc wrought in her drawn features filled me with dumb amazement. Those few hours had bleached her she had lost a woman's last glow of autumn color.;251
"""The effect produced by my news convinced me that his affection for his young collaborator was cordial enough, and this emboldened me to make reply as I did.

""""Monsieur,"""" said I, """"I addressed myself to you in the first instance, as in duty bound.""";251
There hung Hypnos fast, ere the vision of Zeus was observant,    Mounted upon a tall pine-tree, tallest of pines that on Ida    Lustily spring off soil for the shoot up aloft into aether. There did he sit well-cloaked by the wide-branched pine for    concealment,    That loud bird, in his form like, that perched high up in the    mountains,    Chalkis is named by the Gods, but of mortals known as Kymindis.

Thanks to this Gascon toilet, I could hope that the lady would not take me for the local rate collector but now when my thoughts travel back to that episode of my youth, I sometimes laugh at my own expense. Suddenly, just as I was composing myself, at a turning in the green walk, among a wilderness of flowers lighted up by a hot ray of sunlight, I saw Juliette--Juliette and her husband. The pretty little girl held her mother by the hand, and it was easy to see that the lady had quickened her pace somewhat at the child's ambiguous phrase.;251
When I applied again for it, quite lately, I was sternly informed that if the Baron de Rouville had emigrated I should not have lost him that by this time he would have been a rear-admiral finally, his Excellency quoted I know not what degree of forfeiture. I took this step, to which I was urged by my friends, only for the sake of my poor Adelaide. I have always hated the idea of holding out my hand as a beggar in the name of a grief which deprives a woman of voice and strength.;251
Great God! What a terrible phrase! I was too young to bear that tone in her voice I made no reply, only looked at the unhappy woman in helpless bewilderment.;251
I could not, without first informing you, deliver a message to Mme. la Comtesse, a message intrusted to me by an entire stranger but this commission is a sort of sacred trust, a secret of which I have no power to dispose. From the high idea of your character which he gave me, I felt sure that you would not oppose me in the fulfilment of a dying request.;251
What an awful piece of news it was for a woman whose whole thoughts were full of her young lover, who was looking forward hour by hour to a joy which no words can express, a woman who had been at a world of pains to invent plausible pretexts to draw him to her side. Yet, after all, it was a cruel deed of charity to be the messenger of death! So I hurried on, splashing and bemiring myself in the byways of the Bourbonnais.;251
And never was there a purer or more ardent love. On both sides the same trustfulness, the same delicacy, gave their passion increase without the aid of those sacrifices by which many persons try to prove their affection. Between these two there was such a constant interchange of sweet emotion that they knew not which gave or received the most.;251
And that way seems he bound that way the road,    With his dark-lantern mind, unled, alone,    Wearifully through forest-tracts unsown,    He travels, urged by some internal goad. Dares he behold the thing he is, what thing    He would become is in his mind its child    Astir, demanding birth to light and wing    For battle prompt, by pleasure unbeguiled. So moves he forth in faith, if he has made    His mind God's temple, dedicate to truth.;520
"""A certain native reticence made him uncomfortable as he saw his heart's secret so carelessly handled, his passion rent, torn to tatters, a young and unknown girl, whose life seemed to be so modest, the victim of condemnation, right or wrong, but pronounced with such reckless indifference. He pretended to be moved by a spirit of contradiction, asking each for proofs of his assertions, and their jests began again. """"But, my dear boy, have you seen the Baroness' shawl?""""""";251
"""he added, observing the artist's red ribbon. """"That distinction, which we must earn at the cost of our blood and long service, you win in your youth but all glory is of the same kindred,"""" he said, laying his hand on his Cross of Saint-Louis. Hippolyte murmured a few words of acknowledgment, and was silent again, satisfied to admire with growing enthusiasm the beautiful girl's head that charmed him so much.""";251
But the Countess! Ah, how sharp and startling the contrast between husband and wife! The Countess was a little woman, with a flat, graceful figure and enchanting shape so fragile, so dainty was she, that you would have feared to break some bone if you so much as touched her.;251

The young girl's profile was clearly projected against the darkness of his inward vision he saw once more the mother's faded features, or he felt the touch of Adelaide's hands. He remembered some gesture which at first had not greatly struck him, but whose exquisite grace was thrown into relief by memory then an attitude, or the tones of a melodious voice, enhanced by the distance of remembrance, suddenly rose before him, as objects plunging to the bottom of deep waters come back to the surface. So, on the day when he could resume work, he went early to his studio but the visit he undoubtedly had a right to pay to his neighbors was the true cause of his haste he had already forgotten the pictures he had begun.;251
An indescribable odor pervaded the room, a mingled smell of the exhalations from the lumber room, and the vapors of the dining-room, with those from the stairs, though the window was partly open. The air from the street fluttered the dusty curtains, which were carefully drawn so as to hide the window bay, where former tenants had testified to their presence by various ornamental additions--a sort of domestic fresco. Adelaide hastened to open the door of the inner room, where she announced the painter with evident pleasure.;251
"""If after that you still have doubts! well, no one can ever make anything of you you would be capable of marrying your porter's daughter."""" Torn by the most conflicting feelings, the painter parted from his friends.""";251

One must remain young, no doubt, to understand youth. Well, we understood one another to admiration on all the essential points of passion. We had laid it down as an axiom at the very outset, that in theory and practice there was no such piece of driveling nonsense in this world as a certificate of birth that plenty of women were younger at forty than many a girl of twenty and, to come to the point, that a woman is no older than she looks.;251
I know not which had most to tell    Of whence we spring and what we are. HAWARDEN      WHEN comes the lighted day for men to read    Life's meaning, with the work before their hands    Till this good gift of breath from debt is freed,    Earth will not hear her children's wailful bands    Deplore the chieftain fall'n in sob and dirge    Nor they look where is darkness, but on high.

"""""""I need nothing further but a hackney cab to take me home. The porter's wife will go for one."""" He tried to repeat his thanks to the two strangers but at each sentence the elder lady interrupted him, saying, """"Tomorrow, monsieur, pray be careful to put on leeches, or to be bled, and drink a few cups of something healing.""";251
For are they not all comprehended in boundless admiration for the man she loves? When the painter, uneasy at her silence, leaned forward to look at her, she held out her hand, unable to speak a word, but two tears fell from her eyes. Hippolyte took her hand and covered it with kisses for a minute they looked at each other in silence, both longing to confess their love, and not daring.;251
"""And indeed, as he studied Adelaide's noble and almost haughty brow, as he looked into her eyes full of soul and thought, he breathed, so to speak, the sweet and modest fragrance of virtue. In the course of the conversation he seized an opportunity of discussing portraits in general, to give himself a pretext for examining the frightful _pastel_, of which the color had flown, and the chalk in many places fallen away. """"You are attached to that picture for the sake of the likeness, no doubt, mesdames, for the drawing is dreadful?""""""";251
Among other curiosities Hippolyte noticed a splendidly finished telescope, hanging over the small discolored glass that decorated the chimney. To harmonize with this strange collection of furniture, there was, between the chimney and the partition, a wretched sideboard of painted wood, pretending to be mahogany, of all woods the most impossible to imitate. But the slippery red quarries, the shabby little rugs in front of the chairs, and all the furniture, shone with the hard rubbing cleanliness which lends a treacherous lustre to old things by making their defects, their age, and their long service still more conspicuous.;251

"""""""Don't go, don't go!"""" called he. """"Don't trouble yourselves in the least,"""" but he did not offer to accompany us.""";251
Not a little surprised to find her husband contriving some frivolous excuse for leaving us together, she stopped short, giving me a glance--such a glance as women only can give you. In that look of hers there was the pardonable curiosity of the mistress of the house confronted with a guest dropped down upon her from the skies and innumerable doubts, certainly warranted by the state of my clothes, by my youth and my expression, all singularly at variance there was all the disdain of the adored mistress, in whose eyes all men save one are as nothing there were involuntary tremors and alarms and, above all, the thought that it was tiresome to have an unexpected guest just now, when, no doubt, she had been scheming to enjoy full solitude for her love. This mute eloquence I understood in her eyes, and all the pity and compassion in me made answer in a sad smile.;251
The two strangers seemed to forget the painter's works in the painter's mishap. When he had reassured them as to his condition they left, looking at him with an anxiety that was equally free from insistence and from familiarity, without asking any indiscreet questions, or trying to incite him to any wish to visit them. Their proceedings all bore the hall-mark of natural refinement and good taste.;251
We returned to the house. The bell rang, and I was invited to dinner. As we came up to the house, a grave and silent couple, Juliette stole a glance at us.;251
Never before had the old Baroness manifested so ardent a desire to win, or so keen a joy in fingering the old gentleman's gold pieces. During the evening evil suspicions troubled Hippolyte's happiness, and filled him with distrust. Could it be that Madame de Rouville lived by gambling?;251
At this question Schinner colored, remembering the noise he had made. Adelaide said no more, and spared him a falsehood by rising at the sound of a carriage stopping at the door. She went into her own room, and returned carrying a pair of tall gilt candlesticks with partly burnt wax candles, which she quickly lighted, and without waiting for the bell to ring, she opened the door of the outer room, where she set the lamp down.;251
"""""""Willingly,"""" said I. And in the innocence of my heart, I took charge of a rouleau of twenty-five louis d'or, which paid the expenses of my journey back to Paris and only when, on my arrival, I went to the address indicated to repay the amount to M. de Montpersan's correspondent, did I understand the ingenious delicacy with which Juliette had obliged me. Was not all the genius of a loving woman revealed in such a way of lending, in her reticence with regard to a poverty easily guessed?""";251
Hippolyte, who had seen the performance gratis of a comical scene with Monsieur Molineux as concerning certain decorative repairs in his studio, was not surprised to see the dark greasy paint, the oily stains, spots, and other disagreeable accessories that varied the woodwork. And these stigmata of poverty are not altogether devoid of poetry in an artist's eyes. Mademoiselle Leseigneur herself opened the door.;251
Artists themselves acknowledged Schinner as a master, and dealers covered his canvases with gold pieces. At five-and-twenty Hippolyte Schinner, to whom his mother had transmitted her woman's soul, understood more clearly than ever his position in the world. Anxious to restore to his mother the pleasures of which society had so long robbed her, he lived for her, hoping by the aid of fame and fortune to see her one day happy, rich, respected, and surrounded by men of mark.;251
The young man, hearing these words rather more distinctly than all the others, thought it time to retire. Coming back to the world of ordinary ideas, he found a few commonplace remarks to make, took leave of the Baroness, her daughter, and the two strangers, and went away, wholly possessed by the first raptures of true love, without attempting to analyze the little incidents of the evening. On the morrow the young painter felt the most ardent desire to see Adelaide once more.;251
Close with them in their fun, she scarce could guess,    Though these two billowy urchins reeked of craft,    It signalled some adventurous master-trick    To set Olympians buzzing in debate,    Lest it might be their godhead undermined,    The Tyranny menaced. Ephialtes high    On shoulders of his brother Otos waved    For the bull-bellowings given to grand good news,    Compact, complexioned in his gleeful roar    While Otos aped the prisoner's wrists and knees,    With doleful sniffs between recurrent howls    Till Gaea's lap receiving them, they stretched,    And both upon her bosom shaken to speech,    Burst the hot story out of throats of both,    Like rocky head-founts, baffling in their glut    The hurried spout. And as when drifting storm    Disburdened loses clasp of here and yon    A peak, a forest mound, a valley's gleam    Of grass and the river's crooks and snaky coils,    Signification marvellous she caught,    Through gurglings of triumphant jollity,    Which now engulphed and now gave eye at last    Subsided, and the serious naked deed,    With mountain-cloud of laughter banked around,    Stood in her sight confirmed: she could believe    That these, her sprouts of promise, her most prized,    These two made up of lion, bear and fox,    Her sportive, suckling mammoths, her young joy,    Still by the reckoning infants among men,    Had done the deed to strike the Titan host    In envy dumb, in envious heart elate:    These two combining strength and craft had snared,    Enmeshed, bound fast with thongs, discreetly caged    The blood-shedder, the terrible Lord of War    Destroyer, ravager, superb in plumes    The barren furrower of anointed fields    The scarlet heel in towns, foul smoke to sky,    Her hated enemy, too long her scourge:    Great Ares.;520
Hippolyte wanted to feel some tie linking him with his two neighbors, to conquer a right to mingle in their life. His offer, appealing as it did to the liveliest affections of the heart, was the only one he could possibly make it gratified his pride as an artist, and could not hurt the feelings of the ladies. Madame Leseigneur accepted, without eagerness or reluctance, but with the self-possession of a noble soul, fully aware of the character of bonds formed by such an obligation, while, at the same time, they are its highest glory as a proof of esteem.;251
An old Aubusson carpet, very much faded, very much mended, and as worn as a pensioner's coat, did not cover the whole of the tiled floor, and the cold struck to his feet. The walls were hung with a reddish paper, imitating figured silk with a yellow pattern. In the middle of the wall opposite the windows the painter saw a crack, and the outline marked on the paper of double-doors, shutting off a recess where Madame Leseigneur slept no doubt, a fact ill disguised by a sofa in front of the door.;251
"""The painter recollected that for the last two or three evenings Adelaide, while seeming to examine with a girl's curiosity the particular stitch of the worn silk netting, was probably counting the coins in the purse, while making some light jests, quite innocent in appearance, but no doubt with the object of watching for a moment when the sum was worth stealing. """"The old admiral has perhaps good reasons for not marrying Adelaide, and so the Baroness has tried----""""  But at this hypothesis he checked himself, not finishing his thought, which was contradicted by a very just reflection, """"If the Baroness hopes to get me to marry her daughter,"""" thought he, """"they would not have robbed me."""" Then, clinging to his illusions, to the love that already had taken such deep root, he tried to find a justification in some accident.""";251
As I passed the door of the Countess' room on the way to my night's lodging, I asked the servant timidly for news of her. She heard my voice, and would have me come in, and tried to talk, but in vain--she could not utter a sound. She bent her head, and I withdrew.;251
"""Just after this extraordinary gastronomical episode, as the Count was eagerly helping himself to a slice of venison, a housemaid came in with, """"We cannot find madame anywhere, sir!"""" I sprang up at the words with a dread in my mind, my fears written so plainly in my face, that the old canon came out after me into the garden. The Count, for the sake of appearances, came as far as the threshold.""";251
THE MESSAGE   By Honore De Balzac    Translated by Ellen Marriage    To M. le Marquis Damaso Pareto     THE MESSAGE   I have always longed to tell a simple and true story, which should strike terror into two young lovers, and drive them to take refuge each in the other's heart, as two children cling together at the sight of a snake by a woodside. At the risk of spoiling my story and of being taken for a coxcomb, I state my intention at the outset. I myself played a part in this almost commonplace tragedy so if it fails to interest you, the failure will be in part my own fault, in part owing to historical veracity.;251
Next morning, this night-scene among my dreams seemed like a dream to make sure of the piteous truth, I was obliged to look fruitlessly under my pillow for the packet of letters. There is no need to tell you how the next day went. I spent several hours of it with the Juliette whom my poor comrade had so praised to me.;251
Under the low-browed tempest's eye of ire,    That ere it lightened smote a coward heart,    Earth nerved her chastened son to hail athwart    All ventures perilous his shrouded Sire    A stranger still, religiously divined    Not yet with understanding read aright. But when the mind, the cherishable mind,    The multitude's grave shepherd, took full flight,    Himself as mirror raised among his kind,    He saw, and first of brotherhood had sight:    Knew that his force to fly, his will to see,    His heart enlarged beyond its ribbed domain,    Had come of many a grip in mastery,    Which held conjoined the hostile rival twain,    And of his bosom made him lord, to keep    The starry roof of his unruffled frame    Awake to earth, to heaven, and plumb the deep    Below, above, aye with a wistful aim.

Then, prompted by his wrath, he went on to explain to Madame Schinner the secret of his losing intentionally at cards, because the Baronne's pride left him none but these ingenious means of assisting her. When Madame Schinner had paid her respects to Madame de Rouville, the Baroness looked at the Comte de Kergarouet, at the Chevalier du Halga--the friend of the departed Comtesse de Kergarouet--at Hippolyte, and Adelaide, and said, with the grace that comes from the heart, """"So we are a family party this evening.""""""";251

For every man, except the politician, the innovator, Austria is no harsh stepmother. But it is obviously clear that the better in other respects the administration of a state it does but foster the more the desire for that political security, which is only found in constitutional freedom: the reverence paid to personal rights, but begets the passion for political and under a mild despotism are already half matured the germs of a popular constitution. But it is still a grave question whether Italy is ripe for self-government--and whether, were it possible that the Austrian domination could be shaken off--the very passions so excited, the very bloodshed so poured forth, would not ultimately place the larger portion of Italy under auspices less favourable to the sure growth of freedom, than those which silently brighten under the sway of the German Caesar.;761

He was now at the spot in which his brother had left him hastily he glanced behind, and saw the couched lance and horrent crest of the horseman close at his rear despairingly he looked up, and behold!;761
From the distance at which he stood from the scene, Adrian could only distinguish the dark outline of Rienzi's form he could only hear the faint sound of his mighty voice he could only perceive, in the subdued yet waving sea of human beings that spread around, their heads bared in the last rays of the sun, the unutterable effect which an eloquence, described by contemporaries almost as miraculous,--but in reality less so from the genius of the man than the sympathy of the audience,--created in all, who drank into their hearts and souls the stream of its burning thoughts. It was but for a short time that that form was visible to the earnest eye, that that voice at intervals reached the straining ear, of Adrian di Castello but that time sufficed to produce all the effect which Adrian himself had desired. Another shout, more earnest, more prolonged than the first--a shout, in which spoke the release of swelling thoughts, of intense excitement--betokened the close of the harangue and then you might see, after a minute's pause, the crowd breaking in all directions, and pouring down the avenues in various knots and groups, each testifying the strong and lasting impression made upon the multitude by that address.;761

There was a short pause in their conversation, when, just where two streets crossed one another, there was heard a loud noise of laughing voices and trampling feet.

Amidst the other disorders of the time, it was no unfrequent custom for the younger or more dissolute of the nobles, in small and armed companies, to parade the streets at night, seeking occasion for a licentious gallantry among the cowering citizens, or a skirmish at arms with some rival stragglers of their own order.;761

Irene in the Palace of Adrian di Castello. As the Cyprian gazed on the image in which he had embodied a youth of dreams, what time the living hues flushed slowly beneath the marble,--so gazed the young and passionate Adrian upon the form reclined before him, re-awakening gradually to life. And, if the beauty of that face were not of the loftiest or the most dazzling order, if its soft and quiet character might be outshone by many, of loveliness less really perfect, yet never was there a countenance that, to some eyes, would have seemed more charming, and never one in which more eloquently was wrought that ineffable and virgin expression which Italian art seeks for in its models,--in which modesty is the outward, and tenderness the latent, expression the bloom of youth, both of form and heart, ere the first frail and delicate freshness of either is brushed away: and when even love itself, the only unquiet visitant that should be known at such an age, is but a sentiment, and not a passion!;761

It is nothing new to see the Papal Church in the capacity of a popular reformer, and in contra-position to the despotic potentates of the several states, as well as to the German Emperor, who nominally inherits the sceptre of the Caesars.

While the crowd hailed the proposition of Rienzi while their shouts yet filled the air while Raimond, somewhat taken by surprise, sought by signs and gestures to convey at once his gratitude and his humility, the Tribune-Elect, casting his eyes around, perceived many hitherto attracted by curiosity, and whom, from their rank and weight, it was desirable to secure in the first heat of the public enthusiasm.""";761

But that was a revel, was it not? There was grandeur!--fifty servitors in scarlet and gold! and the music playing all the while.;761
Do you remember the summer days, which seemed to me so short, when you repeated to me those old ballads with which Percy revived the decaying spirit of our national muse, or the smooth couplets of Pope, or those gentle and polished verses with the composition of which you had beguiled your own earlier leisure? It was those easy lessons, far more than the harsher rudiments learned subsequently in schools, that taught me to admire and to imitate and in them I recognise the germ of the flowers, however perishable they be, that I now bind up and lay upon a shrine hallowed by a thousand memories of unspeakable affection. Happy, while I borrowed from your taste, could I have found it not more difficult to imitate your virtues--your spirit of active and extended benevolence, your cheerful piety, your considerate justice, your kindly charity--and all the qualities that brighten a nature more free from the thought of self, than any it has been my lot to meet with.;761
So intense was the sensation these words created in the audience--so breathless and overpowered did they leave the souls with they took by storm--that Rienzi had descended the scaffold, and already disappeared behind the curtain from which he had emerged, ere the crowd were fully aware that he had ceased. The singularity of this sudden apparition--robed in mysterious splendour, and vanishing the moment its errand was fulfilled--gave additional effect to the words it had uttered. The whole character of that bold address became invested with a something preternatural and inspired to the minds of the vulgar, the mortal was converted into the oracle and, marvelling at the unhesitating courage with which their idol had rebuked and conjured the haughty barons,--each of whom they regarded in the light of sanctioned executioners, whose anger could be made manifest at once by the gibbet or the axe,--the people could not but superstitiously imagine that nothing less than authority from above could have gifted their leader with such hardihood, and preserved him from the danger it incurred.;761
At length, Adrian, his visor down, rode slowly into the green space, amidst the cheers of his party. The two Knights, at either end, gravely fronted each other they made the courtesies with their lances, which, in friendly and sportive encounters, were customary and, as they thus paused for the signal of encounter, the Italians trembled for the honour of their chief: Montreal's stately height and girth of chest forming a strong contrast, even in armour, to the form of his opponent, which was rather under the middle standard, and though firmly knit, slightly and slenderly built. But to that perfection was skill in arms brought in those times, that great strength and size were far from being either the absolute requisites, or even the usual attributes, of the more celebrated knights in fact, so much was effected by the power and the management of the steed, that a light weight in the rider was often rather to his advantage than his prejudice: and, even at a later period, the most accomplished victors in the tourney, the French Bayard and the English Sydney, were far from remarkable either for bulk or stature.;761
"""In this space, and sheltered by the broad-spreading and classic fagus (so improperly translated into the English """"beech""""), a gay pavilion was prepared, which commanded the view of the sparkling sea--shaded from the sun, but open to the gentle breeze. This was poor Adeline's favourite recreation, if recreation it might be called. She rejoiced to escape from the gloomy walls of her castellated prison, and to enjoy the sunshine and the sweets of that voluptuous climate without the fatigue which of late all exercise occasioned her.""";761
The events of his work are thus already shaped to his hand--the characters already created--what remains for him, is the inner, not outer, history of man--the chronicle of the human heart and it is by this that he introduces a new harmony between character and event, and adds the completer solution of what is actual and true, by those speculations of what is natural and probable, which are out of the province of history, but belong especially to the philosophy of romance. And--if it be permitted the tale-teller to come reverently for instruction in his art to the mightiest teacher of all, who, whether in the page or on the scene, would give to airy fancies the breath and the form of life,--such, we may observe, is the lesson the humblest craftsman in historical romance may glean from the Historical Plays of Shakespeare. Necessarily, Shakespeare consulted history according to the imperfect lights, and from the popular authorities, of his age and I do not say, therefore, that as an historian we can rely upon Shakespeare as correct.;761
"""The Knight himself was clad in mail, which had tested the finest art of the celebrated Ludovico of Milan and, altogether, his appearance was unusually gallant and splendid, and seemed still more so beside the plain but brightly polished and artfully flexile armour of Montreal, (adorned only with his lady's scarf,) and the common and rude mail of his charger. This contrast, however, was not welcome to the Provencal, whose vanity was especially indulged in warlike equipments and who, had he foreseen the """"pastime"""" that awaited him, would have outshone even the Colonna. The trumpeters of either party gave a short blast--the Knights remained erect as statues of iron a second, and each slightly bent over his saddle-bow a third, and with spears couched, slackened reins, and at full speed, on they rushed, and fiercely they met midway.""";761

3. The rich and the great woo thee dearest and poor,      Though his fathers were princes, thy young Troubadour! But his heart never quail'd save to thee, his adored,--      There's no guile in his lute, and no stain on his sword.;761
The lesser nobles were well pleased to hear attacks upon both: while, on the other hand, the Bishop, by the long impunity of Rienzi, had taken courage to sanction the conduct of his fellow-officer. He affected, indeed, at times, to blame the excess of his fervour, but it was always accompanied by the praises of his honesty and the approbation of the Pope's Vicar confirmed the impression of the nobles as to the approbation of the Pope. Thus, from the very rashness of his enthusiasm had grown his security and success.;761
In these reflections there was a truth, the whole gloom and sadness of which the Roman had not yet experienced. However august be the object we propose to ourselves, every less worthy path we take to insure it distorts the mental sight of our ambition and the means, by degrees, abase the end to their own standard. This is the true misfortune of a man nobler than his age--that the instruments he must use soil himself: half he reforms his times but half, too, the times will corrupt the reformer.;761
"""He recovered, as the shout died away and saying to the smith, in a low tone, """"Friend, I am sorry for thy wound but seek me on the morrow, and thou shalt find thou hast wronged me"""" he beckoned to the German to follow him, and threaded his way through the crowd, which generally gave back as he advanced. For the bitterest hatred to the order of the nobles was at that time in Rome mingled with a servile respect for their persons, and a mysterious awe of their uncontrollable power. As Adrian passed through that part of the crowd in which the fray had not yet commenced, the murmurs that followed him were not those which many of his race could have heard.""";761
"""And which conquest were the more glorious,--the barbarous Isle, or the Metropolis of the World? Short step from the general to the podesta--shorter step from the podesta to the king!"""" While thus revolving his wild, yet not altogether chimerical ambition, a quick light step was heard amidst the long herbage, and, looking up, Montreal perceived the figure of a tall female descending from that part of the hill then covered by many convents, towards the base of the Aventine.""";761
And in the earlier vicissitudes of a life which had partly been consumed in exile, he had developed many noble qualities of fortitude, endurance, and real greatness of soul which showed that his failings were rather acquired by circumstance than derived from nature. His numerous and highborn race were proud of their chief and with justice for he was the ablest and most honoured, not only of the direct branch of the Colonna, but also, perhaps, of all the more powerful barons. Seated at the same table with Stephen Colonna was a man of noble presence, of about three or four and thirty years of age, in whom Adrian instantly recognised Walter de Montreal.;761
"""would you could have seen me!--per fede I had caught your mantle!--I was a second you!) and said, weeping like a child, 'Ah, Signor, I am but a poor man, and of little worth but if every drop of blood in this body were a life, I would give it for my country!'"""" """"Brave soul,"""" said Rienzi, with emotion """"would Rome had but fifty such!""";761
"""Howbeit, if thou wouldst bind me to thee for ever, thou wilt suffer me to send for my own charger, and afford me a chance to retrieve mine honour. With that steed, or with one equal to thine, which seems to me of the English breed, I will gage all I possess, lands, castle, and gold, sword and spurs, to maintain this pass, one by one, against all thy train."""" Fortunately, perhaps, for Adrian, ere he could reply, Riccardo Annibaldi cried, with great warmth, """"Sir Knight, I have with me two steeds well practised in the tourney take thy choice, and accept in me a champion of the Roman against the French chivalry--there is my gage.""""""";761
So desperate their charge, and so great their numbers, that the Barons, after a short and tumultuous conflict, were driven back, and chased by their pursuers for more than a mile from the walls of the city. As soon as the Barons recovered their disorder and dismay, a hasty council was held, at which various and contradictory opinions were loudly urged. Some were for departing on the instant to Palestrina, which belonged to the Colonna, and possessed an almost inaccessible fortress.;761
They have given you pomp and power--but the safety of equal laws were a better gift. Oh, were I you--were I Stephen Colonna himself, I should pant, ay, thirstily as I do now, for that free air which comes not through bars and bulwarks against my fellow-citizens, but in the open space of Heaven--safe, because protected by the silent Providence of Law, and not by the lean fears and hollow-eyed suspicions which are the comrades of a hated power. The tyrant thinks he is free, because he commands slaves: the meanest peasant in a free state is more free than he is.;761

"""The monks, ceasing from their hymn, advanced hastily to the spot and indeed the devotion of Montreal had ever induced him to purchase the goodwill of whatever monastery neighboured his wandering home.

"""""""Ah, yes a messenger from Fra Moreale. I wrote to the Knight, reproving him for his desertion on our ill-starred return from Corneto, and intimating that five hundred lances would be highly paid for just now."""" """"Ah,"""" said Savelli """"and what is his answer!""""""";761
"""asked Lucia. """"The old scholar from Avignon!"""" """"What!""";761

""""Forgive me if I do not think highly, in general, of Italian honour, or Italian valour your valour I acknowledge, for I have witnessed it, and valour and honour go together,--let that suffice!""""

"""cried Cecco """"what, Tribune!--would you deny the poor fellows a holiday. They work hard enough, and their only pleasure is seeing your fine shows and processions and then they go home and say,--'See, our man beats all the Barons! what state he keeps!'""""""";761
"""The tribune himself was clothed in a long robe of white satin, whose snowy dazzle (miri candoris) is peculiarly dwelt on by the historian, richly decorated with gold while on his breast were many of those mystic symbols I have before alluded to, the exact meaning of which was perhaps known only to the wearer. In his dark eye, and on that large tranquil brow, in which thought seemed to sleep, as sleeps a storm, there might be detected a mind abstracted from the pomp around but ever and anon he roused himself, and conversed partially with Raimond or Savelli. """"This is a quaint game,"""" said the Orsini, falling back to the old Colonna: """"but it may end tragically.""""""";761

"""""""Let me be your brother,"""" said the gallant boy, affectionately pressing the scholar's hand to his heart """"I want a brother like you.""""

"""""""How! darest thou say I tremble?"""" cried the Baron.""";761
Shortly after sunrise they crossed those fatal swamps which had already been partially drained by Boniface VIII. and Montreal, refreshed by sleep, reconciled to his late mortification by the advantages opened to him in the approaching war with Naples, and rejoicing as he approached a home which held one who alone divided his heart with ambition, had resumed all the gaiety which belonged to his Gallic birth and his reckless habits. And that deadly but consecrated road, where yet may be seen the labours of Augustus, in the canal which had witnessed the Voyage so humourously described by Horace, echoed with the loud laughter and frequent snatches of wild song by which the barbarian robbers enlivened their rapid march.;761

"""To him Mrs. Detlor seemed in a dream, though her lips still smiled and her eyes wandered pleasantly over the heads of the company. She was looking at none of them, but her body was bent slightly toward the window, listening with it, as the deaf and dumb do.

He had traveled much, seen more, remembered everything, was shy to austerity with people who did not interest him, spontaneous with those that did, and yet was never--save to serve a necessary purpose--a hail fellow with any one. He knew that he could be perfectly natural with this woman--say anything that became a man. He was an artist without affectations, a diplomatic man, having great enthusiasm and some outer cynicism.;1285
His face went hot and his hands closed on the palings tightly. He stole into the garden quietly, came near the window and stood still. He held his mouth in his palm.;1285
"""""""Of course you do not--as I say it. But you know what I mean. Women are creatures of impulse, except those who live mechanically and have lost everything.""";1285

"""The group were applauding heartily. A chorus said, """"Another verse, please, Mrs. Detlor.""""""";1285
Of course, it's all handicap. But what difference does that make when it strikes you? You can't help it, can you?;1285
"""Here is her letter."""" CHAPTER III. NO OTHER WAY.""";1285
What was Mark Telford to John Gladney? The thing was not pleasant to consider. The lines were crossing and recrossing.;1285
Both were immediately puzzled, for each had a sensation of some subterranean origin. Telford immediately afterward passed out of the gate and went toward the St. Cloud gardens, where the band was playing.;1285
"""""""Please light a cigar,"""" she said with a little laugh. """"We must not look serious. Assume your light comedy manner as you listen, and I will wear the true Columbine expression.""";1285
She had known less still of his life, for since her marriage she had never set foot in Louisiana, and her mother, while she lived, never mentioned his name or told her more than that the Telford plantation had been sold for a song. When Hagar had told him that Detlor was dead, a wild kind of hope had leaped up in him that perhaps she might care for him still and forgive him when he had told all. These last few minutes had robbed him of that hope.;1285
She only lived. She took a horse and rode far away into the woods. She came near a cottage among the trees.;1285
Mark Telford's first ambition when a child was to ride a horse. As a man he liked horses almost better than men. The cool, stirring rush of wind on his face as he rode was the keenest of delights.;1285
"""He edged close to the window, where a light showed at the edge of the curtains. Suddenly he pulled up. """"No.""";1285
He saw the easels, with their backs to the archway. He rose, went in and looked at the sketches in the dim light. He started, flushed, and his lips drew back over his teeth with an animallike fierceness, but immediately he was composed again.;1285
"""Quick! Paint in his face. Put all his wickedness there.""""""";1285
As he said, it didn't matter if she hated him. It would be worth while remembering, when he had gone, that he had been gentle with her and had spared her the shame of knowing that she had married not only a selfish brute, but a coward and a would be assassin as well. He had only heard rumors of her life since he had last seen her, twelve years before, but he knew enough to be sure that she was aware of Fairfax Detlor's true character.;1285
"""He felt the gray damp light on his eyes, though he could not see He half raised his head. """"God--bless--you, dear!"""" he said.""";1285
There had been more singing by Mrs. Detlor. She ransacked her memory for half remembered melodies--whimsical, arcadian, sad--and Hagar sat watching her, outwardly quiet and appreciative, inwardly under an influence like none he had ever felt before. When his guests were ready, he went with them to their hotel.;1285
"""He picked up the photograph and held it, scrutinizing it. """"She is seventeen,"""" was the reply in a cold voice. He turned a worn face from the picture to the woman.""";1285
"""He understood. """"Yes, I know,"""" he said, """"the light comedy manner."""" He waved his hand toward the drawing.""";1285
"""""""Her name was Marion Conquest. She was beautiful--they said that of her then--and young, only sixteen. She had been very happy, for a man said that he loved her, and she wore his ring on her finger.""";1285
"""""""Yes. I have not seen her in many years. Where is she staying?""""""";1285
"""What complication and fresh misery might be here? """"You may keep the ring,"""" she said. """"Thank you,"""" was his reply, and he put it on his finger, looking down at it with an enigmatical expression.""";1285
I have no hope that you will change it. I think you would make a mistake to do so. You could not have the situation, if the truth were painted.;1285
"""She looked up, as if expecting him to speak. He said nothing, but stood with eyes fixed on the floor. """"I admitted, too, that I kept alive the memory of a man who had played an evil part in my life that I believed I cared for him still, more than for my husband.""""""";1285
Perhaps the new interest in her life was driving out hatred. There was something more. The envelope she had found that day on the moor was addressed to that woman's husband, from whom she had been separated--no one knew why--for years.;1285
"""She smiled a little wistfully. """"You are very ambitious. You needed, you said to me once, a simple but powerful subject which you could paint in with some one's life' blood--that sounds more dreadful than it is * * * well?""";1285

"""Telford rose. """"I took the liberty of waiting for you, and, seeing the pictures, was interested."""" Hagar bowed coldly.""";1285
"""""""I always was a fool."""" Mrs. Detlor sat up, pale, but smiling in a wan fashion. """"I am all right now,"""" she said.""";1285
"""They were quiet again. """"This is the story,"""" she said at last, folding her hands before her. """"No, no,"""" she added hastily, """"I will not tell you the story, I will try and picture one scene.""";1285
"""She paused. People were passing near, and she smiled and bowed once or twice, but Hagar saw that the fire in her eyes had deepened. """"Is it strong enough for your picture?""""""";1285
"""""""I do not wish to, but I will not go."""" """"I had met her five years before there was anything between you and me. She accepted the situation when she understood that I would not marry her.""";1285
"""It came to him indistinctly. """"She has forgotten the rest,"""" he said. Instantly and almost involuntarily he sang:      """"Look up an look aroun,     Fro you burden on de groun.""""""";1285
"""""""Yes, off the coast of Madagascar. But it was never known beyond doubt. The vessel was wrecked and it was said all hands but two sailors were lost.""""""";1285
She took it with an unnatural quietness. She grew distressingly pale, but that was all. Her hand lay clinched tightly on the seat beside her.;1285
Now for the commission you gave me. I'd rather it had been anything else, for I think I'm the last man in the world for duty where women are concerned. That reads queer, but you know what I mean.;1285
There was no particular reason why he should. Mark Telford had gone because he hoped to see Mrs. Detlor without (if he should think it best) being seen by her. Mildred Margrave sat in the seat behind him--he was on the box seat--and so far gained the confidence of the driver as to induce him to resign the reins into his hands.;1285
"""Then she stood with her back to the light of the window. He saw a figure standing in the shadow, came forward and bowed, not at first looking closely at the face. """"I have come from your husband,"""" he said.""";1285
"""If her child--her beautiful, noble child--had lived, she would, perhaps, one day have claimed the property for its sake. This child was her second love and it died--it died."""" She drew from her breast a miniature.""";1285
"""""""But I know that she is coming to see her daughter."""" """"Who is her daughter?"""" She raised her parasol toward the spot where Mildred Margrave stood and said, """"That is her daughter.""""""";1285
She clapped her hands as she saw Baron rise, and the others, for politeness sake, could not urge her more. *       *       *       *       *  For the stranger. Only the morning of that day he had arrived at the pretty town of Herridon among the hills and moors, set apart for the idle and ailing of this world.;1285
"""Mrs. Detlor asked to be driven to her hotel. """"I shall see you this afternoon at the excursion if you are well enough to go,"""" Hagar said to her. """"Perhaps,"""" she said with a strange smile.""";1285
It was Mrs. Detlor. She had, with the young girl who had sat at her feet the evening before, been shown into the outer room, had playfully parted the curtains between the rooms and entered. She stood for a moment looking at the sketch, fascinated, thrilled.;1285
The assurance was given, and the men bowed to each other. Hagar saw a smile play ironically on Telford's face--saw it followed by a steellike fierceness in the eye. He replied to both in like fashion, but one would have said the advantage was with Telford--he had the more remarkable personality.;1285
"""""""That's over,"""" he said as he stood looking at them. """"The king is dead. Long live the king!""""""";1285
"""Telford folded his arms, and, though pale and haggard, held himself firmly. """"I could not have wished this for my worst enemy,"""" he said at last """"Gladney and I have been more than brothers."""" """"In return for having""""--  """"Hush!""""""";1285

"""""""I do not know."""" He slipped a coin into the groom's hand. """"Sit up for me.""";1285

""""But who's the gentleman behind the scenes--in the greenroom?""""

"""""""Ida, for God's sake, you do not mean""""--  """"Yes, I meant you then. But when he went away, when he proved himself so noble, I changed. I learned to hate the memory of the other man.""";1285
"""She guessed what was passing in his mind. She reached out as if to touch his arm again, but did not, and said: """"I am placing you in an awkward position. Pardon me.""";1285
She rose eagerly, and a little pale. He had now sketched in more distinctly the figure of the man, changed it purposely to look more like Telford. She saw her own face first.;1285
"""""""She would never forgive you. She was too good for you, and you ruined her life."""" He was very quiet and spoke in a clear, meditative voice.""";1285
"""""""No, it wasn't to be,"""" he said. """"I'm a dead man anyway,"""" and fell back. Day was breaking when the agony ceased.""";1285
As an artist you were wise to stick to your first conception. It had the heat of inspiration. But I think you can paint me better than you have done, in these sketches.;1285
"""""""Hagar is a fortunate man,"""" he said. Then dreamily: """"You have a daughter. I wish to God that--that ours had lived.""""""";1285
"""Then he said to Baron, """"What did you say was the name of the pretty girl at the View House?"""" """"Mildred, Mildred Margrave--lovely, 'cometh up as a flower,' and all that. You'll see her to-night.""""""";1285
The two then went to the studio again, and, leaving the curtain drawn back, Hagar arranged Mrs. Detlor in position and began his task. He stood looking at the canvas for a time, as though to enter into the spirit of it again then turned to his model. She was no longer Mrs. Detlor, but his subject, near to him as his canvas and the creatures of his imagination, but as a mere woman in whom he was profoundly interested (that at least) an immeasurable distance from him.;1285
"""""""I love to listen to you."""" """"That girl was fatherless, brotherless. There was no man with any right to stand her friend at the time--to avenge her--though, God knows, she wished for no revenge--except a distant cousin who had come from England to see her mother and herself to marry her if he could.""";1285
"""""""I have seen her in London. I am glad--glad that she hates you. I know she does,"""" she added.""";1285
"""""""She lived to be always sorry for herself. She was selfish. She could have thrived on happiness.""";1285
He would see how she had borne the interview with Telford. Presently he saw that Telford was gone. When he reached her, she was sitting, as he had often seen her, perfectly still, her hands folded in her lap upon her parasol, her features held in control, save that in her eyes was a bright, hot flame which so many have desired to see in the eyes of those they love and have not seen.;1285
"""He held the candle above the second sketch. """"This,"""" he said, """"is admirable as art and fiction. But it is fiction.""";1285
"""""""I warn you, dear,"""" he said, """"that it will make a difference, a painful difference, between us."""" """"No, George""""--it was the first time she had called him that--""""nothing can make any difference with that."""" He told her simply, bravely--she was herself so brave--what there was to tell, that two weeks ago her husband was alive, and that he was now on his way to England--perhaps in England itself.""";1285
"""""""I had it all, and I have lost it all,"""" he said. """"Good-bye."""" He did not offer his hand.""";1285
"""Presently she put out her hand and touched his arm. """"You have great tact,"""" she said, """"and I am grateful."""" """"I will not question your judgment,"""" he replied, smiling.""";1285
His father on such occasions called him Young King Cole. All had changed, and many things had happened, as we shall see. But one thing was clear--this was no wild man from the west.;1285
His look wandered to a table whereon was a photograph of her daughter. He glanced at it keenly. A look of singular excitement sprang to his eyes.;1285
"""In herself she was an inspiration to him, but he had not told her that. """"Oh, yes,"""" was his reply, """"I want it, if I may paint you in the scene."""" """"You may paint me in the scene,"""" she said quietly.""";1285
He had only been there twelve hours, yet he was familiar with the place. He had the instincts and the methods of the true traveler. He never was guilty of sightseeing in the usual sense.;1285
Presently there came to him the sound of a banjo--not an unusual thing at Herridon. It had its mock negro minstrels, whom, hearing, Telford was anxious to offend. This banjo, he knew at once, was touched by fingers which felt them as if born on them, and the chords were such as are only brought forth by those who have learned them to melodies of the south.;1285
"""""""I mean no others--no wife or family?"""" """"He has a wife, and she has a daughter. That is all I know.""";1285
Her hands clasped tightly before her. Her eyes turned full on him for an instant, then looked away into the dusk. There was silence for a long time now.;1285
He had claims to be considered, and he was considered. People watched him as he went down over the esplanade and into quiet streets. The little occurrence at the dinner table had set him upon a train of thoughts which he had tried to avoid for many years.;1285
"""Poole made my clothes, and Lincoln is my hatter. Were you ever in Paris?"""" The slow, distinct voice came floating across the little table, and ladies who that day had been reading the last French novel and could interpret every word and tone smiled slyly at each other or held themselves still to hear the sequel the ill-bred turned round and stared the parvenu sitting at the head of the table, who had been a foreign buyer of some London firm, chuckled coarsely and winked at the waiter, and Baron, the Afrikander trader, who sat next to Telford, ordered champagne on the strength of it.""";1285
"""It was madness, but it was so."""" Here she paused. The silence seemed oppressive.""";1285

But he saw, almost unconsciously, that she had dropped his rose. He stooped, picked it up and gave it to her. With a singular coolness--for, though pale, she showed no excitement--she quietly arranged the flower at her throat, still looking at the figure on the platform.;1285
"""Hagar looked at him debatingly, then said, """"You are in love with her, Baron. Isn't it--forgive me--isn't it a pretty mad handicap?"""" Baron ran his hand over his face in an embarrassed fashion, then got up, laughed nervously, but with a brave effort, and replied: """"Handicap, my son, handicap?""";1285
"""They become like priests then."""" """"Like some priests. Yet, with all respect, it is not a confessional I would choose, except the woman was my mother.""""""";1285
"""""""You have something to tell me. Speak it. Say it quickly.""";1285
"""When they had gone, Telford rose and walked back to the ruined abbey. He went to the spot where he had first seen Mrs. Detlor that day, then took the path up the hillside to the place where they had stood. He took from his pocket the ring she had given back to him, read the words inside it slowly, and, looking at the spot where she had stood, said aloud:  """"I met a man once who imagined he was married to the spirit of a woman living at the north pole.""";1285
"""Lord, rather!"""" It was Telford. Hagar wished for the slightest pretext to go up the unfrequented side path and speak to him, but his mind was too excited to do the thing naturally without a stout pretext.""";1285
"""The property he settled on you for your lifetime he will settle on your child. Until this past few days he was himself poor. To-day he is rich--money got honestly, as you may guess.""""""";1285
He had a cigar in his pocket, and though to smoke in the morning was pain and grief to him, he determined to ask for a match, and started. He was stopped by Baron, whose thoughts being much with the little vices of man, anticipated his wishes and offered him a light. In despair Hagar took it, and asked if he chanced to know who the stranger was.;1285
But this was made endurable to the father by the fact that, by nature, the boy was a warrior and a scapegrace, could use his fists as well as his tongue, and posed as a Napoleon with the negro children in the plantation. He was leader of the revels when the slaves gathered at night in front of the huts and made a joy of captivity and sang hymns which sounded like profane music hall songs, and songs with an unction now lost to the world, even as Shakespeare's fools are lost--that gallant company who ran a thread of tragedy through all their jesting. Great things had been prophesied for this youth in the days when he sat upon an empty treacle barrel with a long willow rod in his hand, a cocked hat on his head, a sword at his side--a real sword once belonging to a little Bonaparte--and fiddlers and banjoists beneath him.;1285
"""""""Yes, you get a human element in a Punch and Judy tragedy. Besides, it has surprises, according to the idiosyncrasy of the man in the greenroom."""" He smiled immediately, remembering that his last words plagiarized Mr. Alpheus Richmond.""";1285

The body of it ran:      DEAR MR. HAGAR--I have just learned on my return from the Continent     with the Branscombes that you are at Herridon. My daughter Mildred,     whom you have never seen--and that is strange, we having known each     other so long--is staying at the View House there with the Margraves,     whom, also, I think, you do not know. I am going down to-morrow, and     will introduce you all to each other.;1285
"""Well, well!"""" He heard the outer door open, then immediately Hagar entered the room and came forward to where he sat. The artist was astonished, and for the instant embarrassed.""";1285
There had been one swift wave of the feeling that once flooded her girl's heart. It had passed and left her with the remembrance of her wrongs and the thought of unhappy years--through all which she had smiled, at what cost, before the world! Come what would, he should never know that, even now, the man he once was remained as the memory of a beautiful dead thing--not this man come to her like a ghost.;1285
"""You are a vain race."""" """"You know best. Men show certain traits to women most.""""""";1285
"""Let me know it now. One more shock more or less cannot matter."""" She had an intuition as to what it was.""";1285

"""I purpose, on reaching Fort Harwood, to lay the state of the case before the commandant, and to try and induce him to send me back with a body of men, either to relieve the garrison of the farm should it be attacked, or to go in search of the marauders."""" I thanked the lieutenant kindly for this offer, although I did not suppose that Uncle Jeff and his companions would have any difficulty in beating off their assailants. """"As we must be off by daylight, it is now time to turn in,"""" said the lieutenant.""";8659
"""I learned from Pat Sperry that they have been constantly putting their heads together of late, and he suspects that they intend either to desert, or to do some mischief or other."""" """"Thank you,"""" said the lieutenant """"but do not trouble yourself about such matters now. I will look after the men.""";8659
"""Then an idea seemed to strike him. """"To be sure, your honour, they might have gone fishing up the stream. That broth of a boy Barney might jist have rolled in, and the long Dutchman have tried to haul him out, and both have been carried away together.""";8659
But she was too busily occupied in getting the supper-table ready to notice the admiration she was inspiring. Rachel, with frying-pan in hand, now made her way towards the fire, and begging those who impeded her movements to draw on one side, she commenced her culinary operations. She soon had a huge dish of rashers of bacon ready while a couple of pots were carried off to be emptied of their contents and some cakes, which had been cooking under the ashes, were withdrawn, and placed hot and smoking on the platter.;8659
His nerve and activity equalled his strength. He was no great talker, and he was frequently morose and ill-tempered but he had one qualification which compensated for all his other deficiencies--he was devotedly attached to Uncle Jeff. There were engaged on the farm, besides these, four other hands: an Irishman, a Spaniard, a negro, and a half-breed, who lived by themselves in a rough hut near the house.;8659
Perhaps, after their three or four days' experience, they may have begun to suspect that they would not reach their El Dorado without some considerable difficulty, should they ever get there at all and they possibly consoled themselves with the idea that, since they had been retaken, they were getting off very cheaply. Our meal over, we moved on as before. I kept a sharp look-out by the way, and twice I caught sight of figures which I knew must be Indians, moving in the distance, but whether friends or foes it was impossible to say.;8659
"""""""I wish we could have done better for him,"""" said the stranger """"but many a fine fellow sleeps under such a monument as that."""" I need not dwell upon our grief as we watched these proceedings. I was sure that the sooner Clarice was away from the spot the better it would be for her so, as the leader of the emigrant train did not wish to delay longer than was necessary, I assisted in harnessing the animals to our waggon, and we at once moved on.""";8659
"""I rode on, and just then the moonbeams, shining amid the boughs, shed their light on the figure of a young girl, whose countenance and costume plainly showed that she was an Indian. After surveying my companion and myself--apparently to ascertain who we were--she stepped forth from her place of concealment, and advanced fearlessly towards us. """"How comes it that you are wandering in this forest by yourself?""""""";8659
"""A person unaccustomed to Indians cannot easily distinguish one from another, although in reality they vary in appearance as much as white men do as does also the expression of their countenances. """"Are you going to the farm?"""" he asked, addressing me.""";8659
"""But although neither Clarice nor Rachel could understand his language, they saw very clearly that he greatly required food. """"Come along, den,"""" said Rachel """"you shall hab some in de twinkle ob an eye, as soon as we get home.--Missie Clarice, me carry de pitcher, or Indian fancy you white slavey"""" and Rachel laughed at her own wit. She then told Clarice how she had caught sight of the Indian coming over the mountain, as she was driving home the cow and that, as he was making his way towards the spring, she had been dreadfully alarmed at the idea that he might surprise her young mistress.""";8659
"""Winnemak shook his head at the latter proposal. """"We will aid you as far as we can with our small party,"""" he answered """"but my people would never consent to shut themselves up within walls. They do not understand that sort of fighting.""";8659
Unwilling to be discovered, now that I was fully awake, I was on the point of retreating, when the sound of my footfall reached his ears, and turning round he saw me. I did not wish that he should fancy I was afraid of encountering him, so I at once advanced, and told him frankly how I came to follow him. I assured him, also, that I had had no intention of acting as a spy on his movements.;8659
"""""""We shall probably have some sharp fighting, my lads and if you behave well I intend to overlook your conduct but if not, you must take the consequences,"""" said the lieutenant. """"Sure, if we get sight of an inemy, I will do nothing to disgrace the name of Gillooly,"""" answered Barney. Klitz muttered something in German, but what it was I could not make out.""";8659
Had we felt sure that we would be attacked, we should have been wise to have destroyed many of these out-buildings, as they were calculated to protect the enemy. But to the last Uncle Jeff was not fully persuaded that the Indians would venture to approach the place, as they must have known that we were prepared for their reception. The day drew on, but still Bartle did not return and we began to hope that after all no enemy would appear.;8659
I was thankful to get a substantial meal, after which I lay down with the rest by the side of the stream, to obtain the sleep I so much needed. A few skins had been stretched over some poles to afford shelter to the wounded, who required it more than the rest of us. I had been asleep for several hours, when, suddenly awaking, I happened to turn my eyes across the stream, and saw, partly concealed by the brushwood, the figure of an Indian stooping down and apparently watching us.;8659
This determined those who had before talked of going back to carry out their intentions and notwithstanding the expostulations of my father and others, they turned round the heads of their cattle, and back they went over the road we had come. I had by this time observed that my mother was not looking so well as usual. One night she became very ill, and in spite of all my father and two kind women of our party could do for her, before morning she was dead.;8659
"""""""I will learn what has happened,"""" said Maysotta. I hurried to Winnemak, and explained that his people had made prisoners of those who were on their way to visit his camp. He thought I was mistaken but I assured him that I was not, and that his daughter would corroborate my statement.""";8659
"""""""Dat would not be fair,"""" answered Klitz. """"You got big mout and short body, and can stow away much faster dan I. You eat your breakfast as fast as you like, but let me take mine at my ease.""""""";8659
Heavy and clumsy as the animals looked, so rapidly did they rush over the ground that he could only get within range of two or three of the rearmost. Pulling up, he fired but the buffalo dashed on and, unwilling to fatigue his horse, my father came back, somewhat annoyed at his failure. [Illustration: INDIAN MODE OF ATTACKING BUFFALO.];8659
I accordingly resolved to stop and having examined the locality on the further side, in case I should have to beat a retreat, I sat down and took some food, of which I still had a small portion left. The air was tolerably warm, and, fatigued as I was, I should under ordinary circumstances have slumbered soundly but as it was I felt very little inclination to sleep. I was too anxious about Uncle Jeff, and Bartle, and Gideon.;8659
CHAPTER VII. ON THE MARCH--WINNEMAK UNABLE TO GIVE ME NEWS OF MY FRIENDS--MY      ARGUMENTS IN FAVOUR OF PIOMINGO--ENCAMPED FOR THE NIGHT--WE      REACH WINNEMAK'S CAMP--BRAVES AND SQUAWS--WHERE ARE MY      FRIENDS?--WINNEMAK AND HIS IDOLS--A PARTY OF BRAVES ARRIVE,      WITH PRISONERS--MAYSOTTA AND HER DOG--A STRANGE MEETING--THE      LIEUTENANT'S STORY--WE START IN QUEST OF CLARICE AND RACHEL--A      FRUITLESS SEARCH--I LOSE MY FRIEND IN THE FOREST--TRYING TO      REGAIN THE RIGHT PATH, I MEET WITH CLARICE AND MAYSOTTA--MY      SISTER'S STORY--I TELL HER OF THE BURNING OF THE FARM--WE SET      OUT FOR THE CAMP, AND MEET WITH THE LIEUTENANT--NIGHT COMING      ON, WE ENCAMP IN THE FOREST--RESUMING OUR JOURNEY IN THE      MORNING, WE REACH THE CAMP IN SAFETY. As we proceeded on our journey, I walked alongside the chief, endeavouring to gain from him all the information I could.;8659
"""""""Dere are bad red men, and bad white men, and bad black men but, me tink, not so many ob de last,"""" said Rachel, who always stuck up for her own race. The red man seemed to fancy that they were talking about him and he tried to smile, but failed in the attempt. It was with difficulty, too, he could drag on his weary limbs.""";8659
The next morning we proceeded as before and I was thankful when at length, just as evening was approaching, the chief told me that we were not far from the camp. I looked out eagerly ahead for the first sight of it, for I hoped to meet Clarice and Uncle Jeff there, and to have my anxiety at last set at rest. The sun was just tinging the southern side of the snowy mountains on our left, ere it sank below them, when I caught sight of the wigwams of the Kaskaskias, on the slopes of a pine-covered hill.;8659
"""Uncle Jeff's confidence that he could have come to no harm was not, however, shaken. """"It may be that he has discovered the enemy, and is watching their movements or perhaps he has been tempted to go on and on until he has found out that there is no enemy to be met with, or that they have taken the alarm and beat a retreat,"""" he observed. Still the lieutenant was unwilling to leave us, although Uncle Jeff did not press him to stay.""";8659
Clarice asked Uncle Jeff to tell Winnemak that she should be very glad to become acquainted with Maysotta whenever he could bring her to the farm. Uncle Jeff was so pleased with the Indian, that he made him a present of a rifle and a stock of ammunition telling him that he was sure he would ever be ready to use it in the service of his friends. Winnemak's gratitude knew no bounds, and he expressed himself far more warmly than Indians are accustomed to do.;8659
"""""""Tell the men to be ready,"""" cried Uncle Jeff """"and charge them not to fire until I give the word,--they must not throw a shot away."""" I ran hastily round the building, and ascertained that every man was at his post, prepared for whatever might happen. I then returned to Uncle Jeff for further orders.""";8659
For some distance we travelled through a dense pine forest, following the course of a stream into which we concluded the torrent fell. We frequently had to turn aside to avoid the numberless fallen trunks, or to dismount and lead our animals over them. We thus made but slow progress, and were compelled to encamp in the midst of the forest at a much earlier hour than would have been necessary in the open country.;8659
On and on he had come, until he had reached the base of the Rocky Mountains. He would have gone over them, but, having an eye to business, and knowing that it was necessary to secure a market for his produce, he calculated that he had come far enough for the present. He therefore climbed the sides of the mountain for a short distance, until he entered a sort of canon, which, penetrating westward, greatly narrowed, until it had the appearance of a cleft with lofty crags on either side,--while it opened out eastward, overlooking the broad valley and the plain beyond.;8659
I could not have supposed that he would have exhibited so much activity, judging from his appearance when clothed in his usual robes. Although he appeared to be a strong, muscular man, the other Indian, from his movements, was evidently young and active. How he had ventured to approach the camp without being armed, was a mystery.;8659
I occasionally stopped and looked back, expecting that my friends would overtake me and although I did not see them, I felt so sure that they must be close behind that I continued my course. On and on I went, when again I found myself descending, and thus knew that I had crossed over a hill of some height still the trees prevented me from getting a view of the country beyond. At last I came to some marshy ground of a similar character to that which I had met on the other side of the lake, with sulphur springs in the centre.;8659
"""murther! are we all going to be drowned entirely at the bottom? Sure the river's burst over us!""""""";8659
I had now very little fear of being overtaken indeed, the Indians would probably have lost my trail in the streams I had crossed, while the rocky nature of the ground would scarcely bear marks sufficient for even their acute eyes to discover. I knew that as yet I could not be abreast of Winnemak's camp, and, indeed, that across the mountains it would probably take me two or three days to reach it. Still I felt that it would be prudent, in case the Indians should be scouring the country in the plains, to keep to the mountains for another whole day or so.;8659
"""""""They had white men with them--and only the bravest of their warriors took part in the fight,"""" he replied. I could only trust that Winnemak was right in his conjecture, and that we should find Clarice and her escort at the camp. With regard to Uncle Jeff, I was still more anxious, and I began to fear that, notwithstanding his clever trick, he might not have escaped the bullets and arrows of his pursuers or his horse might have fallen, and he have been taken prisoner.""";8659
"""""""Here is a pot suitable for the witches' caldron in Macbeth,"""" cried out Manley. He was rather ahead of me, and on overtaking him I found him standing by the side of a circular basin whose diameter we calculated to be fully twenty feet. The contents consisted of what greatly resembled hasty pudding, or, as Manley said, """"a huge caldron of thick mash.""""""";8659
But still we saw nothing of Klitz or Gillooly, while the waning light prevented me from discovering their trail, had they crossed where we did. Some way ahead was a large wood, which extended to the very foot of the mountains, and within its recesses we should be able to shelter ourselves from any onset of horsemen, although the trees would favour the approach of enemies who might attempt to take us by surprise. We rode on, skirting the forest as long as we had sufficient light to distinguish objects at any distance, still with the hope that we might find the runaways encamped, in case they should not have seen us.;8659
"""""""It is useless,"""" answered Winnemak """"I have said it, and it must be done."""" Just then, from behind the shelter of a wood on one side of the mountains, a mounted warrior dashed out. I saw at once that it was Piomingo.""";8659
"""""""Any of the rest of your people wounded? If there are, and your party will come on to our camp, we will render you all the assistance in our power."""" """"Only two of our men have been hit, and that but slightly and my wound is nothing,"""" answered my father.""";8659
"""I therefore stepped out of my place of concealment and Maysotta, who was delighted to find me, said that she had come out expressly to search for us, and would take us immediately to the camp. Of course, I could not go without Rachel, and we are now on our way to look for her, as she cannot be far off."""" [Illustration: FOUND AT LAST!]""";8659
The Indian girl readily undertook the charge of our baggage-mules and property, as well as of the deserters' wheel-barrow, which she promised should be sent back to the farm. Having secured the muskets of the two men to our own saddles, we made them mount and ride on before us, so that they might have no opportunity of running away. Gillooly pulled as long a face as his jovial countenance was capable of, while that of Klitz elongated even more than was its wont.;8659
In the meantime Bartle and Gideon had reloaded, and two more warriors shared the fate of the first. As yet, all the success had been on our side and there appeared every probability of our being able to defeat any attempt of the enemy to enter the building. Those who had got into the stables were so many withdrawn from the attack and although under shelter, they could effect nothing against us.;8659
We accordingly hobbled and staked our horses close at hand and we then collected wood for our fire, and made down our beds with our saddles and horse-cloths. While we were seated at supper, I proposed to my companion to go a short distance from the wood, that we might command a more extensive range of view than we could where we were seated so that should the runaways be anywhere in the neighbourhood, we might find them out by the light of their fire. No glare appeared, however, along the whole length of the forest but still that was no proof that they were not somewhere in one of its recesses, as, even should they have kindled a fire, the trees might conceal its light from us.;8659
"""""""Sure, now, we were afther thinking your honour was kilt intirely,"""" continued Barney. """"Might I be so bold as to ax where your honour comes from now?"""" """"Let me inquire where you come from, and how you escaped from the burning house,"""" I said.""";8659
"""In vain we searched for a way by which we might reach the bottom of the gorge we were soon convinced that the cliff was utterly impracticable. """"It can't be helped,"""" cried Uncle Jeff """"but we must not give up the hope of obtaining some venison this evening. The elk will not long remain out on these barren rocks, and if we can hide ourselves near where they have to pass, we may each of us kill one.""""""";8659
"""""""Dat I could not let dis fellow, like one big baby, go alone,"""" answered the German """"so I went to take care of him."""" There was no use in bandying words just then, so the lieutenant ordering Klitz to take up the muskets, and Gillooly, as before, to trundle the wheel-barrow, we set off, guided by Maysotta, for the Indian camp. We found but few persons in the camp, and these chiefly women and children,--the men having accompanied their chief.""";8659
The spot was exposed to a hot sun by day, and to cold winds by night, and there were no materials at hand to build a hut indeed, but little wood even to form a fire. At last I proposed setting off to try and obtain help,--though, should the troops or the Indians who accompanied us have gone south, it might be a long time before I could fall in with any one. There was nothing else to be done, however, as far as we could see, although I greatly feared that before I could return Bartle would have succumbed.;8659
When Indians can manage to attack a train on the move, they, in most instances, prove successful whereas even a small party of white men, when encamped and under the protection of their waggons, can generally keep a large band of warriors at bay. The fact of our not meeting with any emigrant trains made Maysotta's report more probable. Of course I felt somewhat anxious about ourselves, for, even although we had a couple of rifles and two muskets, besides our pistols, we might find it a hard matter to drive off any large number of mounted assailants but I felt far more anxious about the inmates of the farm.;8659
Some of them, we found, had thrown themselves into the mill, which afforded them sufficient shelter to fire steadily at our loopholes with less risk of being hit in return. None of us had hitherto been struck, but no sooner had the mill been taken possession of than two of the farm hands, who were less cautious than the experienced hunters, were badly wounded--one of them mortally, while the other was unable to handle his rifle. The palisade being now burned to the ground, we were deprived of its protection, and our assailants could consequently get close up to the walls.;8659
AS THE LIEUTENANT AND I ARE STARTING, WE HEAR THAT KLITZ AND      BARNEY HAVE GONE OFF WITH A WHEELBARROW FOR CALIFORNIA--A      PLEASANT BIVOUAC--AT LAST WE CATCH SIGHT OF THE DESERTERS--THE      LIEUTENANT IS ABOUT TO RIDE AFTER THEM, WHEN A PARTY OF INDIANS      APPEAR--THE INDIANS TAKE TO FLIGHT, AND WE LOSE SIGHT OF THE      RUNAWAYS--FORM OUR CAMP--DISCOVER THAT WE ARE WATCHED--FOLLOW      THE SPY, WHO PROVES TO BE MAYSOTTA--FIND THE DESERTERS TAKING      THEIR EASE--WE CAPTURE THEM, AND, GUIDED BY MAYSOTTA, TAKE THEM      TO THE INDIAN CAMP--RESOLVE TO RETURN TO THE FARM. The lieutenant and I had arranged to start at daybreak, on horseback, with a couple of baggage mules carrying provisions and camp utensils. Clarice was up to give us our breakfast, and I heard the lieutenant tell her how much he hoped to meet her again.;8659
"""""""We ourselves can give them such schooling as they require,"""" replied my father. """"You will make Clarice as accomplished as yourself, and I will take good care of Ralph. It is not book learning a lad requires to get on in this country.""";8659
"""The Indian again uttered a significant """"Ugh!"""" as, taking advantage of Uncle Jeff's offer, he seated himself by the fire. """"Why, uncle,"""" exclaimed Clarice, """"it is Winnemak!""""""";8659
After walking for a quarter of an hour or more, I found myself in the midst of an Indian burial-ground, which I recognized by the number of small platforms, raised on posts and thatched over, rising in all directions. Besides the platforms, I observed several strange-looking figures fixed to the top of tall poles, and composed, as far as I could judge, of bits of coloured rags and skins, which fluttered in a weird fashion in the night breeze. The chief stopped before a couple of these fantastic-looking objects, and, with folded arms, gazed up at them, uttering some words which I was too far off to hear distinctly, though the sound of his voice reached my ears.;8659
The two farms were no doubt much inferior in value to what they would have been with buildings, outhouses and fencings, standing crops and stock yet, even as they stood, they were worth a good sum, for they were already cleared--the chief work of the settler being thus done. However, they realized as much as my father expected, and with a well-equipped train and several hired attendants we set out. The first part of our journey was tolerably easy the emigrants were good-humoured, we had abundance of provisions, the country was well watered, and the cattle could obtain plenty of rich grass to keep up their strength.;8659
As soon as Pat made his appearance, the lieutenant ordered him to stand on guard at the door, where he kept him until nightfall. When our men came in, I inquired whether they knew anything of the troopers. They one and all averred that they had left them sleeping in the hut, and that they had no notion where they could have gone.;8659
"""""""Well done!"""" cried my father. """"I should like to have another, though"""" and hurrying down the hill, he mounted his horse and galloped off in chase of the retreating herd.""";8659
Sometimes I would fancy that I heard the war-whoops of the Indians behind me at others the sounds which I conjured up appeared to be uttered by Bartle or Gideon. I would stop to listen, but only the roar of some distant waterfall or the murmur of a nearer rapid struck my ear. Or now and again I heard the cry of some bird of prey, as it swooped down from its lofty eyrie towards the carcass which it had espied far off on the plain below.;8659
"""I was much struck by the artless manners of the young Indian girl, who, although endowed with the features of her race, possessed a beauty rarely seen among them. """"Move on, lads we must be at Roaring Water before nightfall,"""" cried the lieutenant. """"Keep together, and do not pull rein until I give the order.""";8659
"""From this cataract our location obtained its name of """"Roaring Water"""" but it was equally well known as """"Uncle Jeff's Farm."""" Our neighbours, if such they could be called in this wild region, were """"birds of passage."""" Now and then a few Indian families might fix their tents in the valley below or a party of hunters or trappers might bivouac a night or two under the shelter of the woods, scattered here and there or travellers bound east or west might encamp by the margin of the river for the sake of recruiting their cattle, or might occasionally seek for shelter at the log-house which they saw perched above them, where, in addition to comfortable quarters, abundant fare and a hospitable welcome--which Uncle Jeff never refused to any one, whoever he might be, who came to his door--were sure to be obtained.""";8659
"""cried Pat. """"I will venture on it,"""" said the sergeant. We hurried to the spot, and, in spite of the expostulations of a few old squaws who had remained to watch them, we cut the ropes which bound the unhappy captives to the stakes.""";8659
On the way we looked into the stables, where we found the five horses and baggage mules all right so that the men, if they had deserted, must have done so on foot. We opened the door of the hut, hoping that possibly by this time the missing men might have returned but neither of them was there. The drunken fellow was, however, still sleeping on, and probably would have slept on until his hut companions came back, had we not roused him up.;8659
From their previous daring conduct, we could not hope, however, that they intended to raise the siege perhaps they only waited to see whether the flames from the out-buildings would set the house on fire, and thus save them all further trouble and danger. But the wind, fortunately, continued to blow up the valley, keeping the flames away from the house. Uncle Jeff now directed me to go round and give some food to each man.;8659
There was Bartle Won, a faithful follower, for many years, of Uncle Jeff but as unlike him as it was possible that any two human beings could be. Bartle was a wiry little fellow, with bow legs, broad shoulders (one rather higher than the other), and a big head, out of which shone a pair of gray eyes, keen as those of a hawk--the only point in which he resembled Uncle Jeff. He was wonderfully active and strong, notwithstanding his figure and as for fatigue, he did not know what it meant.;8659
After following the trail, we found that it took the way along the mountains. This was rather an advantage in some respects, as, being accustomed to mountain travelling, we might move on faster than those of whom we were in pursuit. As, however, we were made of flesh and blood, we were obliged to encamp at night, although the dawn of day found us again in pursuit.;8659
It would be necessary to use great caution as I approached the further end, as only the more delicate branches hung over the stream, and should I venture on one incapable of bearing my weight I should fall into the torrent, which there went roaring by at a fearful rate. This very circumstance, however, should I succeed, would secure my safety, as, even should the Indians discover by what means I had crossed, they would not venture to follow or if they did, would most probably fall into the current and be swept away. I did not stop to ascertain how far off my pursuers were, but, climbing up on the trunk, I made my way along it--trusting to the uncertainty of their aim, should any with muskets see me and fire.;8659

"""""""We have no wish to take the places of the prisoners, or to have bloodshed in the matter. At the same time, we are resolved to fight for our lives, should your people attempt to molest us."""" """"You indeed speak boldly,"""" said the chief.""";8659
"""""""Oh, let her come with us!"""" exclaimed Clarice. """"I wish to show her that I am grateful for the service which she rendered me and she may perhaps be pleased with the life we lead.""";8659
"""""""If my men are there, we shall have no difficulty in recovering them or should the fire prove to be at the camp of hostile Indians, we shall be able to retreat unobserved."""" Maysotta had no fear on the latter point, and advising us to picket our horses where we then were, she led the way towards the point she had described. In many places the thick foliage prevented the moonbeams from penetrating through the forest, and we could with difficulty distinguish the figure of our conductress, at so rapid a rate did she glide on through the forest.""";8659
Perhaps they belonged to Winnemak's tribe or, should Maysotta's account be correct, they might be Arrapahas. They did not approach us, however, and we were allowed to proceed unmolested. Although we were moving along the line used by emigrant trains, we did not meet a single one but it was possible that any coming from the eastward might have been attacked by the Arrapahas, or, hearing that an enemy was in the neighbourhood, might have halted for the purpose of defending themselves.;8659
Having in vain attempted to reach the farm, he had stationed a band of his best warriors to afford us support should we have deserted the house, or attempted afterwards to cut our way out of it. I was much disappointed to find that he could give me no information about Uncle Jeff, or about any of our friends he was not even aware that Clarice had gone to join his daughter at the camp. He expressed his satisfaction at hearing that she had escaped the fate which had, he supposed, befallen all the inmates of the farm.;8659
Fortunately, Lieutenant Broadstreet had sufficient supplies of provisions for all our wants. We were thus not altogether destitute of the necessaries of life, for we had, I remember, even tea and coffee, sugar and salt. The lieutenant had also a very small bell-tent, the canvas of which formed scarcely half a load for a man.;8659
"""""""Our friend Winnemak was not romancing,"""" he answered. """"There were fully as many warriors on the war-path as he stated but, for some reason or other, they turned about and are going south. I came upon their trail after they had broken up their last camp, and I had no difficulty in getting close enough to them to make out their numbers, and the tribes they belong to.""";8659
A shower of bullets went whistling through the figure and on either side of it still the horse kept on his way uninjured. [Illustration: A RACE FOR LIFE.] The Indians, who had their horses tethered below, mounted in haste, and pushed on in hot chase.;8659
"""""""I am not the man to propose going back,"""" said Uncle Jeff """"but unless we can find an opening in these rocks, it is very clear that our present party cannot go forward. I propose, therefore, that we should camp here until we have explored the country ahead, after which we shall be able to form our plans."""" He looked towards Clarice as he spoke.""";8659
Their rifles lay at a little distance, and close to their wheelbarrow, which seemed to be well loaded. There was no danger, therefore, of their firing at us before they discovered who we were and, besides, they were not likely men to offer any determined resistance. We amused ourselves for some little time in watching them and certainly no two individuals could have afforded a greater contrast.;8659
"""she asked. """"I don't think much about him and I don't suppose he thinks much about such a wild fellow as I am,"""" he said in a careless tone. """"I wish you would, then,"""" she said """"nobody can be happy if they do not trust in God and accept his offer of salvation, because they cannot feel secure for a moment without his love and protection and they will not know where they are to go to when they die.""""""";8659
*       *       *       *       *  The hut had been thoroughly cleaned out, and Clarice, Maysotta, and Rachel had taken possession of it, while the rest of the party occupied the mill. Lieutenant Broadstreet had, in the meantime, fixed on a good site for a fort on the summit of a precipice by the river-side, and his men were busily engaged in cutting and fixing up the palisades which were to surround it. So much was he occupied in the duty he had to perform, that he could rarely come over to Roaring Water while I was so fully employed that I had no time to visit him.;8659
"""You are now at liberty to pursue your journey on your intended visit to the young squaw of whom you speak,"""" he answered. """"I would follow the advice of the Paleface chief, but I am weary and hungry, and require sleep and rest. He would not turn me away like a dog from his door!""""""";8659
It could not then have wanted more than a couple of hours to dawn. The only sounds which reached my ear were those from our animals as they cropped the rich grass, or the occasional scream of some night-bird in the forest. The moon, too, was nearly at its full, and I was thus enabled to see objects at a distance distinctly.;8659
"""She has several times expressed a wish to know how white people spend their time."""" The chief, who seldom interfered with the movements of his daughter, replied that she was at liberty to do as she wished, and that we should find her in the camp at the foot of the mountains. Lieutenant Broadstreet had to rejoin his men as soon as possible, and no time, therefore, was lost in commencing our journey down the mountain.""";8659
Being, I suspect, of a roving disposition, he had travelled through most of the Eastern States without finding any spot where he could make up his mind to settle. At length he bent his steps to Ohio in the western part of which he had one night to seek shelter from a storm at the farm of a substantial settler, a Mr. Ralph Crockett (the father of Uncle Jeff). Mr. Crockett treated the English stranger with a hospitality which the farmers of Ohio never failed to show to their guests.;8659
"""we feared that you were lost,"""" exclaimed Manley, """"and we have been hunting for you day after day. How haggard you look! How did you manage to lose us?""";8659
Pulling it up, I found it not unlike a radish in taste and consistency. Searching about, I soon found several more: and although not likely to be very nutritious, the roots served to stop the gnawings of hunger, and enabled me to make my way with a more elastic step. My thoughts were occupied as to the probability of finding Manley and the sergeant.;8659
But, as I looked below, I saw a precipice of fearful depth, which it would be impossible to descend. I had observed, as I came by, a steep slope leading upwards on our right, thickly covered with snow. I thought, however, that it might afford us a way by which, having ascended it, we could reach a part of the mountain from whence to descend with less risk than from that on which we now stood, so I shouted to my companions to take it.;8659
"""We kept the two men moving ahead of us at such a rate that Barney more than once cried out, """"Sure, lieutenant, our bastes will have no wind left in thim at all, at all, if we don't pull up!"""" """"Go on, go on,"""" cried the lieutenant """"do not mind your beasts, as long as they can keep their legs."""" """"Thin it's meself I'd be plading for,"""" cried Barney, turning round.""";8659
Again I was becoming faint with my exertions, and my food was exhausted. Whenever I stopped to rest, too, my mind dwelt upon the fearful scenes I had witnessed, and the fate of my friends. I was not altogether free from anxiety about Clarice, either.;8659
I pleaded for the poor wretch that he had not done us any injury as yet that though he had been watching the camp, we could not tell that he had any sinister object in doing so and that, as his life had been preserved, it would be barbarous to take it afterwards. The chief heard me very patiently, but he was evidently unmoved by all my arguments. I now and then went up and spoke to the poor prisoner, who, I suspected, was still suffering great pain, although Indian fortitude forbade him to give expression to his feelings.;8659
"""She is happy, we know she trusted in Christ, and has gone to dwell with him."""" Clarice succeeded better than I did in soothing our poor father's grief. I thought that he himself would now wish to go back, but he was too proud to think of doing that.""";8659
We now made preparations to separate from our Indian friends. None of them were willing to encounter the fatigue and dangers necessary to be undergone in crossing the mountains they also evidently believed the region to be enchanted, and, if inhabited at all, to be the abode of spirits, or beings differing greatly from the human race. When Maysotta heard we were going, she begged Clarice and Rachel to remain with her but Clarice had made up her mind to accompany us, and was fully prepared for all the difficulties we might have to encounter.;8659
My father laughed at the way in which the Ohio farmer spoke of Old England but notwithstanding that, he thought the matter over seriously. He was influenced not a little, too, I have an idea, by the admiration he felt for the farmer's only daughter, Mary Crockett. My father had the price of his commission still almost intact and it was looked upon as almost a princely fortune to begin with in that part of the world.;8659
The Indians being still near us, we thought it only too probable that we should again be attacked. And, indeed, our anticipations were soon fully realized. In less than half an hour, after having apparently been reinforced, they once more came on, but this time with the intention of attacking only one side.;8659

As we travelled along they showed no inclination to decamp, but chatted and laughed, each in his own style--Barney being undoubtedly the leading wit of the party. They were heartily welcome at Roaring Water, and both Klitz and Barney showed that they were willing and able to work. The only thing which seemed to put the German out was when any allusion was made to a wheel-barrow.;8659
"""Just then I met Sergeant Custis and Pat Sperry. """"Now is our time to do a kind deed,"""" I said """"it may be at some risk, but let us set the other prisoners free."""" """"Sure, won't I, thin!""""""";8659
"""""""He intends acting the part of the cunning fox, and will yet make an effort to escape."""" Piomingo turned his eyes towards the speaker, apparently understanding him. I was still making every effort to restore him, when several of Winnemak's followers came up.""";8659
"""But perhaps he was merely a coward, and finding that we would not take his advice and desert the farm, he had escaped, to avoid the danger to which he would be exposed. However, if he intended treachery, it was better to have him out of the way. """"Maybe, afther all, the spalpeen is hiding somewhere,"""" observed Gillooly, when he found that we were inquiring for the Indian """"if he is anywhere inside, sure I'll ferret him out"""" and the Irishman immediately began poking his nose into every hole and cranny in the building.""";8659
Although some white men have set us a bad example, it is no reason that all should do so. The truths about which you speak are independent of man. There must be bad white men as well as bad red men but I am sure that those who follow the example of Him of whom you tell me, the Son of the Great Spirit, must be good men.;8659
At length, overcome by fatigue, I fell asleep, trusting that He by whom I had been mercifully preserved would watch over me. When I at last awoke, daylight was glancing across the foaming waters, the only sound I heard being that of their roar as they rushed over their rocky bed towards the valley below. I knelt down and prayed, as I had been accustomed to do from my childhood and then, before resuming my journey, I took some of the scanty remains of the food I had brought with me, which I washed down with a draught from the stream.;8659
We numbered fifty in all, besides the drivers of the baggage horses and mules conveying our provisions and ammunition. All not absolutely necessary encumbrances were dispensed with, our camp equipage consisting of a few iron pots, tin cups, and plates. Lieutenant Broadstreet had command of the party, and he was directed to select a fit site for a new fort in the neighbourhood of Roaring Water, to assist in holding the Arrapahas in check for the future.;8659

The prince or chief governor was elected annually, but only by the nobles. The people had no rights at all, and were glad to assign themselves as slaves to any noble who was strong enough to protect them. In peace the Druids exercised the main functions of government.;1583
The principle of Charlemagne, that his officers should govern according to local custom, helps them to achieve their own independence, while it preserves all that is left of national liberty and law. The counts, assisted by inferior judges, hold diets from time to time-- thrice, perhaps, annually. They also summon assemblies in case of war.;1583
Both were of vast stature. The gigantic Gaul derided the Roman soldiers as a band of pigmies. The German excited astonishment by his huge body and muscular limbs.;1583
Nevertheless, he imagined himself governed by a profound policy. He had one dominant idea, to make Burgundy a kingdom. From the moment when, with almost the first standing army known to history, and with coffers well filled by his cautious father's economy, he threw himself into the lists against the crafty Louis, down to the day when he was found dead, naked, deserted, and with his face frozen into a pool of blood and water, he faithfully pursued this thought.;1583
The old Frisian laws consisted almost entirely of a discriminating tariff upon crimes. Nearly all the misdeeds which man is prone to commit, were punished by a money-bote only. Murder, larceny, arson, rape--all offences against the person were commuted for a definite price.;1583
He was assisted by a board of eighteen or twenty councillors. The deputies to the general congress were chosen by popular suffrage in Easter-week. The clergy were not recognized as a political estate.;1583
"""The sword and the pen, strength and intellect, no longer the exclusive servants or instruments of priestcraft, are both in open revolt. Charles the Bold storms one fortress, Doctor Grandfort, of Groningen, batters another. This learned Frisian, called """"the light of the world,"""" friend and compatriot of the great Rudolph Agricola, preaches throughout the provinces, uttering bold denunciations of ecclesiastical error.""";1583

The splendid tapestries, silks, linens, as well as the more homely and useful manufactures of the Netherlands, are prized throughout the world. Most ingenious, as they had already been described by the keen-eyed Caesar, in imitating the arts of other nations, the skillful artificers of the country at Louvain, Ghent, and other places, reproduce the shawls and silks of India with admirable accuracy. Their national industry was untiring their prosperity unexampled their love of liberty indomitable their pugnacity proverbial.;1583
Twenty-five was the limited number, including Philip himself, as grand master. The chevaliers were emperors, kings, princes, and the most illustrious nobles of Christendom while a leading provision, at the outset, forbade the brethren, crowned heads excepted, to accept or retain the companionship of any other order. The accession of so potent and ambitious a prince as the good Philip boded evil to the cause of freedom in the Netherlands.;1583
He could strike down a bull in the ring like a matador at Madrid, or win the prize in the tourney like a knight of old he could ride at the ring with the Flemish nobles, hit the popinjay with his crossbow among Antwerp artisans, or drink beer and exchange rude jests with the boors of Brabant. For virtues such as these, his grave crimes against God and man, against religion and chartered and solemnly-sworn rights have been palliated, as if oppression became more tolerable because the oppressor was an accomplished linguist and a good marksman. But the great reason for his popularity no doubt lay in his military genius.;1583
Tried by the only touchstone applicable to governments, their capacity to insure the highest welfare of the governed, we shall not find his polity deserving of much admiration. It is not merely that he was a despot by birth and inclination, nor that he naturally substituted as far as was practicable, the despotic for the republican element, wherever his hand can be traced. There may be possible good in despotisms as there is often much tyranny in democracy.;1583
If they were to have rulers, it was better to serve a Roman emperor than a German witch. Thus murmured the people. Had Civilis been successful, he would have been deified but his misfortunes, at last, made him odious in spite of his heroism.;1583
Religion, too, upon all great historical occasions, has acted as the most powerful of dissolvents. Otherwise, had so many valuable and contrasted characteristics been early fused into a whole, it would be difficult to show a race more richly endowed by Nature for dominion and progress than the Belgo-Germanic people. Physically the two races resembled each other.;1583
The burgher class controlled the government, not only of the cities, but often of the provinces, through its influence in the estates. Industry and wealth had produced their natural results. The supreme authority of the sovereign and the power of the nobles were balanced by the municipal principle which had even begun to preponderate over both.;1583
The twenty-six ward-masters, appointed, two from each ward, by the Senate on nomination by tie wards, formed the third estate. Their especial business was to enrol the militia and to attend to its mustering and training. The deans of the guilds, fifty-four in number, two from each guild, selected by the Senate, from a triple list of candidates presented by the guilds, composed the fourth estate.;1583
Ameni wore a fine pleated robe of snow-white linen, which reached to his ankles, round his hips was a scarf adorned with fringes, which in front formed an apron, with broad, stiffened ends which fell to his knees a wide belt of white and silver brocade confined the drapery of his robe. Round his throat and far down on his bare breast hung a necklace more than a span deep, composed of pearls and agates, and his upper arm was covered with broad gold bracelets. He rose from the ebony seat with lion's feet, on which he sat, and beckoned to a servant who squatted by one of the walls of the sitting-room.;1800
[Small statuettes, placed in graves to help the dead in the work      performed in the under-world. They have axes and ploughs in their      hands, and seed-bags on their backs. The sixth chapter of the Book      of the Dead is inscribed on nearly all.];1800
"""I can do nothing, nothing at all, and guide my instruments with hardly more certainty than a sculptor condemned to work in the dark."""" """"Something like the blind Resu then,"""" said Pentaur smiling, """"who understood painting better than all the painters who could see."""" """"In my operations there is a 'better' and a 'worse'"""" said Nebsecht, """"but there is nothing 'good.'""""""";1800
Many of the sharers in this feast wore long, snowwhite garments, and were of the class of the Initiated into the mysteries of the faith, as well as chiefs of the different orders of priests of the House of Seti. The second prophet, Gagabu, who was to-day charged with the conduct of the feast by Ameni--who on such occasions only showed himself for a few minutes--was a short, stout man with a bald and almost spherical head. His features were those of a man of advancing years, but well-formed, and his smoothly-shaven, plump cheeks were well-rounded.;1800
cried Pentaur, raising his head in astonishment while the blood mounted to his cheeks. The high-priest went up to him and laid both hands on his shoulders. They were of equal height and of equally symmetrical build  even the outline of their features was similar.;1800
"""What gifts of the Gods doth he lack? He has the faculty of learning--of thinking--of feeling--of winning all hearts, even mine. He keeps himself undefiled and separate--""""suddenly the prelate paused and struck his hand on the back of a chair that stood by him.""";1800
flew through his mind. His fancy was lively, and vividly brought before him how the daughter of the Pharaoh with a crown on her proud head would bustle into the silent chamber, how the chattering courtiers would follow her, and how the women by the walls, the physicians by the side of the sick girl, the sleek white cat from the chest where she sat, would rise and throng round her. There must be frightful confusion.;1800
"""The Mohar turned his full face towards her, and she was frightened at the wild fire that glowed in the glance with which he gazed at her.

Her delicate perception made her feel what trenchant discord her appearance offered to all that surrounded her, and the discord pained her for she could not conceal from herself that misery and external meanness were here entitled to give the key-note and that her magnificence derived no especial grandeur from contrast with all these modest accessories, amid dust, gloom, and suffering, but rather became disproportionate and hideous, like a giant among pigmies. She had already gone too far to turn back, or she would willingly have done so.

The poet was as a novice in the order in which Nebsecht was master, but quite capable of understanding its most difficult points so it happened that Nebsecht attached greater value to his judgment than to that of his own colleagues, who showed themselves fettered by prejudice, while Pentaur's decision always was free and unbiassed.;1800

All that he found in nature he referred to himself and the current of his life. It was at once touching, and pitiful, to see how closely he lived with the Manes of his dead.
